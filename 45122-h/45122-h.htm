<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>This book has been prepared in accordance with a
wish expressed by many known and unknown
admirers of my husband's writings, who desire to
possess in a portable form the passages that have
specially appealed to them in his different works, and
in the <cite>Life and Letters</cite>.</p>

<p>I have taken this opportunity of adding extracts
from private letters, and from the writings he left
unfinished, which would not otherwise have become
known to any but his own family or a few intimate
friends.</p>

<p>Those who have read the <cite>Life and Letters</cite>, do not
need to be told that Max Müller lived from his earliest
years in the firm conviction that all is wisely ordered
in this life, and 'all for our real good, though we
do not always see it, and though we cannot venture
to fathom the wisdom guiding our steps through
life.'</p>

<p>To others his unswerving trust and faith as shown
in these extracts may be a revelation, for he seldom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
talked on such subjects. This trust and faith gave
him strength through the bitter struggles of his early
life, taught him resignation during the years when
the dearest wish of his heart seemed unattainable,
supported him later when those he tenderly loved
were snatched from him by death, and upheld him
in his last long and depressing illness.</p>

<p>My earnest desire is that this little book may prove
a help and comfort to many exposed to like trials, and
strengthen those whose path now stretches before
them as a sunny avenue, to meet the sorrows that
almost surely await them as life advances.</p>

<h2>THE ART OF LIFE</h2>


<p>To learn to understand one another is the great
art of life, and to 'agree to differ' is the best
lesson of the comparative science of religion.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Silesian Horseherd.</em>
</p>


<p>There is a higher kind of music which we all
have to learn, if our life is to be harmonious,
beautiful, and useful. There are certain intervals
between the young and the old which must be there,
which are meant to be there, without which life
would be monotonous; but out of these intervals and
varieties the true art of life knows how to build up
perfect harmonies.... Even great sorrow may be a
blessing, by drawing some of our affections away
from this life to a better life ... of which, it is true,
we know nothing, but from which, when we see the
wisdom and love that underlie this life, we may hope
everything. We are meant to hope and to trust, and
that is often much harder than to see and to know.... The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
greatest of all arts is the art of life, and the
best of all music the harmony of spirits. There are
many little rules to be learnt for giving harmony and
melody to our life, but the thorough bass must be&mdash;love.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Life.</em>
</p>


<p>One thing is necessary above all things in order
to live peaceably with people, that is, in Latin,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Humanitas</i>, German, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Menschlichkeit</i>. It is difficult to
describe, but it is to claim as little as possible from
others, neither an obliging temper nor gratitude, and
yet to do all one can to please others, yet without
expecting them always to find it out. As men are
made up of contradictions they are the more grateful
and friendly the less they see that we expect gratitude
and friendliness. Even the least cultivated people
have their good points, and it is not only far better
but far more interesting if one takes trouble to find
out the best side and motives of people, rather than
the worst and most selfish.... Life is an art,
and more difficult than Sanscrit or anything else.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Life.</em>
</p>


<p>We become chiefly what we are more through
others than through ourselves, and happy is
the man whose path in life leads him only by good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
men and brings him together with good men. How
often we forget in judging others the influences under
which they have grown up. How can one expect a
child to be truthful when he sees how servants, yes
often parents, practise deceit. How many children
hear from those to whom they look up, expressions,
principles, and prudent rules of life, which consciously
or unconsciously exercise an influence on the young
life of the child. Yet with how little of loving
introspection we pass our judgments.</p>

<h2>THE BEAUTIFUL</h2>


<p>Is the Beautiful without us, or is it not rather
within us? What we call sweet and bitter is
our own sweetness, our own bitterness, for nothing
can be sweet or bitter without us. Is it not the same
with the Beautiful? The world is like a rich mine,
full of precious ore, but each man has to assay the
ore for himself, before he knows what is gold and
what is not. What, then, is the touchstone by which
we assay the Beautiful? We have a touchstone for
discovering the good. Whatever is unselfish is good.
But&mdash;though nothing can be beautiful, except what is
in some sense or other good, not everything that is
good is also beautiful. What, then, is that something
which, added to the good, makes it beautiful? It is a
great mystery. It is so to us as it was to Plato.
We must have gazed on the Beautiful in the dreams
of childhood, or, it may be, in a former life, and now
we look for it everywhere, but we can never find it,&mdash;never
at least in all its brightness and fulness again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
never as we remember it once as the vision of a half-forgotten
dream. Nor do we all remember the same
ideal&mdash;some poor creatures remember none at all....
The ideal, therefore, of what is beautiful is
within us, that is all we know; how it came there we
shall never know. It is certainly not of this life, else
we could define it; but it underlies this life, else we
could not feel it. Sometimes it meets us like a smile
of Nature, sometimes like a glance of God; and if
anything proves that there is a great past, and a great
future, a Beyond, a higher world, a hidden life, it is
our faith in the Beautiful.</p>

<h2>THE BIBLE</h2>


<p>The fault is ours, not theirs, if we wilfully misinterpret
the language of ancient prophets, if we
persist in understanding their words in their outward
and material aspect only, and forget that before
language had sanctioned a distinction between the
concrete and the abstract, between the purely spiritual
as opposed to the coarsely material, the intention of
the speakers comprehended both the concrete and the
abstract, both the material and the spiritual, in a
manner which has become quite strange to us, though
it lives on in the language of every true poet.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Science of Religion.</em>
</p>


<p>Canonical books give the reflected image only
of the real doctrines of the founder of a new
religion; an image always blurred and distorted by
the medium through which it had to pass.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Science of Religion.</em>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>


<p>The Old Testament stands on a higher ethical
stage than other sacred books,&mdash;it certainly
does not lose by a comparison with them. I always
said so, but people would not believe it. Still, anything
to show the truly historical and human character
of the Old Testament would be extremely
useful in any sense, and would in nowise injure the
high character which it possesses.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Life.</em>
</p>


<p>If we have once learnt to be charitable and reasonable
in the interpretation of the sacred books
of other religions, we shall more easily learn to be
charitable and reasonable in the interpretation of our
own. We shall no longer try to force a literal sense
on words which, if interpreted literally, must lose
their true and original purport; we shall no longer
interpret the Law and the Prophets as if they had
been written in the English of our own century, but
read them in a truly historical spirit, prepared for
many difficulties, undiscouraged by many contradictions,
which, so far from disproving the authenticity,
become to the historian of ancient language and
ancient thought the strongest confirmatory evidence
of the age, the genuineness, and the real truth of
ancient sacred books. Let us but treat our own
sacred books with neither more nor less mercy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
than the sacred books of any other nations, and they
will soon regain that position and influence which
they once possessed, but which the artificial and
unhistorical theories of the last three centuries have
wellnigh destroyed.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Science of Religion.</em>
</p>


<p>By the students of the science of religion the Old
Testament can only be looked upon as a strictly
historical book by the side of other historical books.
It can claim no privilege before the tribunal of history,
nay, to claim such a privilege would be to really
deprive it of the high position which it justly holds
among the most valuable monuments of the distant
past. But the authorship of the single books which
form the Old Testament, and more particularly the
dates at which they were reduced to writing, form
the subject of keen controversy, not among critics
hostile to religion, but among theologians who treat
these questions in the most independent, but at the
same time the most candid and judicial, spirit. By
this treatment many difficulties, which in former times
disturbed the minds of thoughtful theologians, have
been removed, and the Old Testament has resumed
its rightful place among the most valuable monuments
of antiquity.... But this was possible on one
condition only, namely, that the Old Testament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
should be treated simply as an historical book, willing
to submit to all the tests of historical criticism
to which other historical books have submitted.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, II.</em>
</p>


<p>What the student of the history of the continuous
growth of religion looks for in vain
in the books of the Old Testament, are the successive
stages in the development of religious concepts. He
does not know which books he may consider as more
ancient or more modern than other books. He asks
in vain how much of the religious ideas reflected in
certain of these books may be due to ancient tradition,
how much to the mind of the latest writer. In
Exodus iii. God is revealed to Moses, not only as the
supreme, but as the only God. But we are now told
by competent scholars that Exodus could not have
been written down till probably a thousand years
after Moses. How then can we rely on it as an
accurate picture of the thoughts of Moses and his
contemporaries? It has been said with great truth
that 'it is almost impossible to believe that a people
who had been emancipated from superstition at the
time of the Exodus, and who had been all along
taught to conceive God as the one universal Spirit,
existing only in truth and righteousness, should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
found at the time of Josiah, nearly nine hundred
years later, steeped in every superstition.' Still, if
the writings of the Old Testament<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> were contemporaneous
with the events they relate, this retrogressive
movement would have to be admitted. Most
of these difficulties are removed, or considerably
lessened, if we accept the results of modern Hebrew
scholarship, and remember that though the Old
Testament may contain very ancient traditions, they
probably were not reduced to writing till the middle
of the fifth century <small>B.C.</small>, and may have been
modified by and mixed up with ideas belonging to
the time of Ezra.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, II.</em>
</p>


<p>May we, or may we not, interpret, as students
of language, and particularly as students of
Oriental languages, the language of the Old Testament
as a primitive and as an Oriental language? May we,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
or may we not, as true believers, see through the veil
which human language always throws over the most
sacred mysteries of the soul, and instead of dragging
the sublimity of Abraham's trial and Abraham's
faith down to the level of a merely preternatural
event, recognise in it the real trial of a human soul,
the real faith of the friend of God, a faith without
stormwinds, without earthquakes and fires, a faith in
the still small voice of God?</p>

<p class="sig">

</p>


<p>Is it really necessary to say again and again what
the Buddhists have said so often and well, that
the act of creation is perfectly inconceivable to any
human understanding, and that, if we speak of it
at all, we can only do so anthropomorphically or
mythologically?</p>

<h2>CHILDREN</h2>


<p>All seems so bright and perfect, and quite a new
life seems to open before me, in that beloved
little child. She helps me to look forward to such a
far distance, and opens quite a new view of one's own
purpose and duties on earth. It is something new to
live for, to train a human soul entrusted to us, and
to fit her for her true home beyond this life.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Life.</em>
</p>


<p>I doubt whether it is possible to take too high a
view of life where the education of children is
concerned. It is the one great work entrusted to us,
it forms the true religion of life. Nothing is small or
unimportant in forming the next generation, which is
to carry on the work where we have to leave it
unfinished. No single soul can be spared&mdash;every one
is important, every one may be the cause of infinite
good, or of infinite mischief, for ever hereafter.</p>

<h2>CHRIST, THE LOGOS</h2>


<p>An explanation of <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">Logos</i> in Greek philosophy is
much simpler than is commonly supposed. It
is only needful not to forget that for the Greeks
thought and word were inseparable, and that the same
term, namely <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">Logos</i>, expressed both, though they distinguished
the inner from the outer <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">Logos</i>. It is one
of the most remarkable aberrations of the human
mind to imagine that there could be a word without
thought, or a thought without word. The two are
inseparable; one cannot exist or be even conceived
without the other.</p>

<p>In nearly all religions God remains far from man.
I say in nearly all religions: for in Brahmanism
the unity, not the union, of the human soul with
Brahma is recognised as the highest aim. This unity
with Deity, together with phenomenal difference,
Jesus expressed in part through the <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">Logos</i>, in part
through the Son. There is nothing so closely allied
as thought and word, Father and Son. They can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
distinguished but never separated, for they exist only
through each other. In this matter the Greek philosophers
considered all creation as the thought or
the word of God, and the thought 'man' became
naturally the highest <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">Logos</i>, realised in millions of
men, and raised to the highest perfection in Jesus.
As the thought exists only through the word, and the
word only through the thought, so also the Father
exists only through the Son, and the Son through the
Father, and in this sense Jesus feels and declares
himself the Son of God, and all men who believe in
Him His brethren. This revelation or inspiration
came to mankind through Jesus. No one knew the
Father except the Son, who is in the bosom of the
Father, and those to whom the Son willeth to reveal
Him. This is the Christian Revelation in the true
sense of the word.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Silesian Horseherd.</em>
</p>


<p>Small as may be the emphasis that we now lay
on the <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">Logos</i> doctrine, in that period (<em>i.e.</em> of the
Fourth Gospel) it was the centre, the vital germ, of
the whole Christian teaching. If we read any of the
writings of Athanasius, or of any of the older church
fathers, we shall be surprised to see how all of them
begin with the word (<i lang="el" xml:lang="el">Logos</i>) as a fixed point of departure,
and then proceed to prove that the Word is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the Son of God, and finally that the Son of God is
Jesus of Nazareth. Religion and philosophy are here
closely related.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Silesian Horseherd.</em>
</p>


<p>What is true Christianity if it be not the belief
in the true sonship of man, as the Greek
philosophers had rightly surmised, but had never seen
realised on earth? Here is the point where the two
great intellectual currents of the Aryan and Semitic
worlds flow together, in that the long-expected
Messiah of the Jews was recognised as the <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">Logos</i>,
the true Son of God, and that He opened or revealed
to every man the possibility to become what he had
always been, but had never before apprehended, the
highest thought, the Word, the Logos, the Son of
God.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Silesian Horseherd.</em>
</p>


<p>Eternal life consists in knowing that men have
their Father and their true being in the only
true God, and that as sons of this same Father, they
are of like nature with God and Christ.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Silesian Horseherd.</em>
</p>


<p>Why should the belief in the Son give everlasting
life? Because Jesus has through His own sonship
in God declared to us ours also. This knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
gives us eternal life through the conviction that we
too have something divine and eternal within us,
namely, the word of God, the Son whom He hath
sent. Jesus Himself, however, is the only begotten
Son, the light of the world. He first fulfilled and
illumined the divine idea which lies darkly in all men,
and made it possible for all men to become actually
what they have always been potentially&mdash;sons of
God.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Silesian Horseherd.</em>
</p>


<p>We make the fullest allowance for those who,
from reverence for God and for Christ, and
from the purest motives, protest against claiming for
man the full brotherhood of Christ. But when they
say that the difference between Christ and mankind
is one of kind, and not of degree, they know not
what they do, they nullify the whole of Christ's
teaching, and they deny the Incarnation which they
pretend to teach.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, IV.</em>
</p>


<p>The Ammergau play must be very powerful. And
I feel sure just now nothing is more wanted
than to be powerfully impressed with the truly human
character of Christ; it has almost vanished under the
extravagant phraseology of hymns and creeds, and
yet how much greater is the simple story of His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
unselfish life than all the superlatives of later Theology.
If one knows what it is to lose a human soul whom
one has loved&mdash;how one forgets all that was human,
and only clings to what was eternal in it, one can
understand the feelings of Christ's friends and disciples
when they saw Him crucified and sacrificed, the
innocent for those whom He wished to guide and
save.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>MS.</em>
</p>


<p>Jesus destroyed the barrier between man and God,
the veil that hid the Holiest was withdrawn.
Man was taught to see what the prophets had seen
dimly, that he was near to God, that God was near
to every one of us, that the old Jewish view of a
distant Jehovah had arisen from an excess of reverence,
had filled the heart of man with fear, but not
with love. Jesus did not teach a new doctrine, but
He removed an old error, and that error, that slavish
fear of God, once removed, the human heart would
recover the old trust in God&mdash;man would return like
a lost son to his lost father, he would feel that if he
was anything, he could only be what his God had
made him, and wished him to be. And if a name
was wanted for that intimate relation between God
and man, what better name was there than Father
and Son?</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>MS.</em>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>


<p>Those who deprived Jesus of His real humanity
in order to exalt Him above all humanity were
really undoing His work. Christ came to teach us,
not what He was, but what we are. He had seen
that man, unless he learnt himself to be the child of
God, was lost. All his aspirations were vain unless
they all sprang from one deep aspiration, love of
God. And how can we love what is totally different
from ourselves? If there is in us a likeness, however
small, of God, then we can love our God, feel
ourselves drawn towards Him, have our true being
in Him. That is the essence of Christianity, that
is what distinguishes the Christian from all other
religions. And yet that very kernel and seed of
Christianity is constantly disregarded, is even looked
upon with distrust. Was not Christ, who died for
us, more than we ourselves? it is said. Or again,
Are we to make ourselves gods? Christ never says
that He is different from ourselves; He never taught
as a God might teach. His constant teaching is, that
we are His brethren, and that we ought to follow
His example, to become like Him, because we were
meant to be like Him. In that He has come near
to God, as near as a son can be to His father; He is
what He was meant to be. We are not, and hence
the deep difference between Him and us.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>MS.</em>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>


<p>Then it is said, Is not Christ God? Yes, He is,
but in His own sense, not in the Jewish nor in
the Greek sense, nor in the sense which so many
Christians attach to that article of their faith. Christ's
teaching is that we are of God, that there is in us
something divine, that we are nothing if we are not
that. He also teaches that through our own fault
we are now widely separated from God, as a son
may be entirely separated and alienated from his
father. But God is a perfect and loving Father&mdash;He
knows that we can be weak, and yet be good, and
when His lost sons return to Him He receives them
and forgives them as only a father can forgive. Let
us bestow all praise and glory on Christ as the best
son of God. Let us feel how unworthy we are to
be called His brothers, and the children of God, but
let us not lose Christ, and lose our Father whom He
came to show us, by exalting Jesus beyond the place
which He claimed Himself. Christ never calls Himself
the Father, He speaks of His Father with love,
but always with humility and reverence. All attempts
to find in human language a better expression than
that of son have failed. Theologians and philosophers
have tried in vain to define more accurately the relation
of Christ to the Father, of man to God. They
have called Christ another person of the Godhead.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Is that better than Christ's own simple human language,
I go to my Father?</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>MS.</em>
</p>


<p>Christ has been made so unreal to us, He has
been spoken of in such unmeasured terms that
it is very difficult to gain Him back, such as He was,
without a fear of showing less reverence and love of
Him than others. And yet, unreal expressions are
always false expressions&mdash;nothing is so bad as if we
do not fully mean what we say. Of course we know
Christ through His friends only, they tell us what He
told them&mdash;they represent Him as He appeared to
them. What fallible judges they often were they do
not disguise, and that, no doubt, raises the value of
their testimony, but we can only see Him as they saw
Him; the fact remains we know very little of Him.
Still, enough remains to show that Christ was full of
love, that He loved not only His friends, but His
enemies. Christ's whole life seems to have been one
of love, not of coldness. He perceived our common
brotherhood, and what it was based on, our common
Father beyond this world, in heaven, as He said.</p>

<h2>CHRISTIANITY</h2>


<p>Christianity is Christianity by this one fundamental
truth, that as God is the father of man,
so truly, and not poetically, or metaphorically only,
man is the son of God, participating in God's very
essence and nature, though separated from God by
self and sin. This oneness of nature between the
Divine and the human does not lower the concept of
God by bringing it nearer to the level of humanity;
on the contrary, it raises the old concept of man and
brings it nearer to its true ideal. The true relation between
God and man had been dimly foreseen by many
prophets and poets, but Christ was the first to proclaim
that relation in clear and simple language. He called
Himself the Son of God, and He was the firstborn son
of God in the fullest sense of that word. But He
never made Himself equal with the Father in whom
He lived and moved and had His being. He was man
in the new and true sense of the word, and in the new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and true sense of the word He was God. To my
mind man is nothing if He does not participate in the
Divine.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Chips.</em>
</p>


<p>True Christianity lives, not in our belief, but in
our love, in our love of God, and in our love
of man founded on our love of God.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Chips.</em>
</p>


<p>True Christianity, I mean the religion of Christ,
seems to me to become more and more exalted
the more we know and the more we appreciate the
treasures of truth hidden in the despised religions of
the world. But no one can honestly arrive at that
conviction unless he uses honestly the same measure
for all religions.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Science of Religion.</em>
</p>


<p>The position which Christianity from the very
beginning took up with regard to Judaism
served as the first lesson in comparative theology,
and directed the attention even of the unlearned to
a comparison of two religions, differing in their
conception of the Deity, in their estimate of humanity,
in their motives of morality, and in their hope of
immortality, yet sharing so much in common that
there are but few of the psalms and prayers in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Old Testament in which a Christian cannot heartily
join even now, and but few rules of morality which
he ought not even now to obey.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Science of Religion.</em>
</p>


<p>It was exactly because the doctrine of Christ, more
than that of the founders of any other religion,
offered in the beginning an expression of the highest
truths in which Jewish carpenters, Roman publicans,
and Greek philosophers could join without dishonesty,
that it has conquered the best part of the world. It
was because attempts were made from very early
times to narrow and stiffen the outward expression of
our faith, to put narrow dogma in the place of trust
and love, that the Christian Church often lost those
who might have been its best defenders, and that the
religion of Christ has almost ceased to be what, before
all things, it was meant to be, a religion of world-wide
love and charity.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Hibbert Lectures.</em>
</p>


<p>The founder of Christianity insisted again and
again on the fact that He came to fulfil, and
not to destroy; and we know how impossible it
would be to understand the true position of Christianity
in the history of the world, the true purport of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
'fullness of time,' unless we always remember that
its founder was born and lived and died an Israelite.
Many of the parables and sayings of the New Testament
have now been traced back, not only to the Old
Testament, but to the Talmud also; and we know
how difficult it was at first for any but a Jew to
understand the true meaning of the new Christian
doctrine.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, I.</em>
</p>


<p>There is no religion in the whole world which
in simplicity, in purity of purpose, in charity,
and true humanity, comes near to that religion which
Christ taught to His disciples. And yet that very
religion, we are told, is being attacked on all sides.
The principal reason for this omnipresent unbelief is,
I believe, the neglect of our foundations, the disregard
of our own bookless religion, the almost disdain of
Natural Religion. Even bishops will curl their lips
when you speak to them of that natural and universal
<em>religion</em> which existed before the advent of our
historical religions, nay, without which all historical
religions would have been as impossible as poetry is
without language. Natural religion may exist and
does exist without revealed religion&mdash;revealed religion
without natural religion is an utter impossibility.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, I.</em>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>


<p>There can be no doubt that free inquiry has swept
away, and will sweep away, many things which
have been highly valued, nay, which were considered
essential by many honest and pious minds. And yet
who will say that true Christianity, Christianity which
is known by its fruits, is less vigorous now than it
has ever been before? There have been discussions
in the Christian Church from the time of the Apostles
to our own times. We have passed through them
ourselves, we are passing through them now.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, II.</em>
</p>


<p>When we think of the exalted character of
Christ's teaching, may we not ask ourselves
once more, What would He have said if He had seen
the fabulous stories of His birth and childhood, or if
He had thought that His Divine character would ever
be made to depend on the historical truth of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Evangelia Infantiae</i>?</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, II.</em>
</p>


<p>Much of the mere outworks of Christianity
cannot hold the ground on which they have
been planted, they have to be given up by force at
last, when they ought to have been given up long
before; and when given up at last, they often tear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
away with them part of the strength of that faith of
which they had previously been not only the buttress
outside, but a part of the living framework.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, III.</em>
</p>


<p>What we call Christianity embraces several
fundamental doctrines, but the most important
of them all is the recognition of the Divine in man,
or, as we call it, the belief in the Divinity of the Son.
The belief in God, let us say in God the Father, or
the Creator and Ruler of the world, had been elaborated
by the Jews, and most of the civilised and
uncivilised nations of the world had arrived at it.
But when the Founder of Christianity called God His
Father, and not only His Father, but the Father of all
mankind, He did no longer speak the language of
either Jews or Greeks. To the Jews, to claim Divine
sonship for man would have been blasphemy. To
the Greeks, Divine sonship would have meant no
more than a miraculous, a mythological event. Christ
spoke a new language, a language liable, no doubt, to
be misunderstood, as all language is; but a language
which to those who understood it has imparted a new
glory to the face of the whole world. It is well known
how this event, the discovery of the Divine in man, which
involves a complete change in the spiritual condition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
of mankind, and marks the great turning-point in the
history of the world, has been surrounded by a
legendary halo, has been obscured, has been changed
into mere mythology, so that its real meaning has
often been quite forgotten, and has to be discovered
again by honest and fearless seeking. Christ had to
speak the language of His time, but He gave a new
meaning to it, and yet that language has often retained
its old discarded meaning in the minds of His earliest,
nay sometimes of His latest disciples also. The Divine
sonship of which He speaks was not blasphemy as the
Jews thought, nor mythology as so many of His own
followers imagined, and still imagine. Father and
Son, divine and human, were like the old bottles that
could hardly hold the new wine; and yet how often
have the old broken bottles been preferred to the new
wine that was to give new life to the world.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, III.</em>
</p>


<p>If we have learnt to look upon Christianity, not
as something unreal and unhistorical, but as an
integral part of history, of the historical growth of the
human race, we can see how all the searchings after
the Divine or Infinite in man were fulfilled in the
simple utterances of Christ. His preaching, we are
told, brought life and immortality to light. Life, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
life of the soul, and immortality, the immortality of
the soul, were there and had always been there. But
they were brought to light, man was made fully
conscious of them, man remembered his royal birth,
when the word had been spoken by Christ.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, III.</em>
</p>


<p>We must never forget that it was not the
principal object of Christ's teaching to make
others believe that He only was divine, immortal, or
the son of God. He wished them to believe this for
<em>their own</em> sake, for <em>their own</em> regeneration. 'As
many as received Him to them gave He power to
become the sons of God.' It might be thought, at
first, that this recognition of a Divine element in man
must necessarily lower the conception of the Divine.
And so it does in one sense. It brings God nearer to
us, it bridges over the abyss by which the Divine and
the human were completely separated in the Jewish,
and likewise in many of the pagan religions. It
rends the veil of the temple. This lowering, therefore,
is no real lowering of the Divine. It is an expanding
of the concept of the Divine, and at the same time
a raising of the concept of humanity, or rather a
restoration of what is called human to its true character,&mdash;a
regeneration, or a second birth, as it is called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
by Christ Himself. 'Except a man be born again, he
cannot see the kingdom of God.'</p>

<p class="sig"><em>Gifford Lectures, III.</em>
</p>


<p>There is a constant action and reaction in the
growth of religious ideas, and the first action
by which the Divine was separated from and placed
almost beyond the reach of the human mind, was
followed by a reaction which tried to reunite the two.
This process, though visible in many religions, was
most pronounced in Judaism in its transition to
Christianity. Nowhere had the invisible God been
further removed from the visible world than in the
ancient Jewish religion, and nowhere have the two
been so closely drawn together again and made one
as by that fundamental doctrine of Christianity, the
Divine sonship of man.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, IV.</em>
</p>


<p>Christ spoke to men, women, and children, not
to theologians, and the classification of His
sayings should be made, not according to theological
technicalities, but according to what makes our own
heart beat.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Life.</em>
</p>


<p>The yearning for union or unity with God, which
we see as the highest goal in other religions,
finds its fullest recognition in Christianity, if but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
properly understood, that is, if but treated historically,
and it is inseparable from our belief in man's full
brotherhood with Christ. However imperfect the
forms may be in which that human yearning for God
has found expression in different religions, it has
always been the deepest spring of all religions, and
the highest summit reached by Natural Religion.
The different bridges that have been thrown across
the gulf that seems to separate earth from heaven and
man from God, may be more or less crude and faulty,
yet we may trust that many a faithful soul has been
carried across by them to a better home. It is quite
true that to speak of a bridge between man and God,
even if that bridge is called the Self, is but a metaphor.
But how can we speak of these things except in
metaphors? To return to God is a metaphor, to
stand before the throne of God is a metaphor, to be
in Paradise with Christ is a metaphor.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, IV.</em>
</p>


<p>The Christian religion should challenge rather than
deprecate comparison. If we find certain doctrines
which we thought the exclusive property of
Christianity in other religions also, does Christianity
lose thereby, or is the truth of these doctrines impaired
by being recognised by other teachers also?</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, IV.</em>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>


<p>Love&mdash;superseding faith&mdash;seems to be the keynote
of all Christianity. But the world is still
far from true Christianity, and whoever is honest
towards himself knows how far away he himself is
from the ideal he wishes to reach. One can hardly
imagine what this world would be if we were really
what we profess to be, followers of Christ. The first
thing we have to learn is that we are not what we
profess to be. When we have learnt that, we shall
at all events be more forbearing, forgiving, and
loving towards others. We shall believe in them,
give them credit for good intentions, with which, I
hope, not hell, but heaven, is paved.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Life.</em>
</p>


<p>Our religion is certainly better and purer than
others, but in the essential points all religions
have something in common. They all start with the
belief that there is something beyond, and they are all
attempts to reach out to it.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Life.</em>
</p>


<p>How little was taught by Christ, and yet that is
enough, and every addition is of evil. Love
God, love men&mdash;that is the whole law and the
prophets&mdash;not the Creeds and the Catechism and the
Articles and the endless theological discussions. We
want no more, and those who try to fulfil that simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
law, know best how difficult it is, and how our whole
life and our whole power are hardly sufficient to
fulfil that short law.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>MS.</em>
</p>


<p>Christ's teaching is plainly that as He is the Son
of God so we are His brothers. His conception
of man is a new one, and as that is new, so must His
conception of God be new. He lifts up humanity,
and brings deity near to humanity, and He expresses
their inseparable nature and their separate existences
by the best simile which the world supplies, that of
Father and Son. He claims no more for Himself than
He claims for us. His only excellence is that which
is due to Himself&mdash;His having been the first to find
the Father, and become again His Son, and His
having remained in life and death more one with the
Father than any one of those who professed to believe
in Him, and to follow His example.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>MS.</em>
</p>


<p>If Jesus was not God, was He, they ask, a mere
man? A <em>mere</em> man? Is there anything among
the works of God, anything next to God, more
wonderful, more awful, more holy than man? Much
rather should we ask, Was then Jesus a mere God?
Look at the miserable conceptions which man made to
himself as long as he spoke of gods beside God? It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
could not be otherwise. God is one, and he who
admits other gods beside or without Him degrades,
nay, denies and destroys the One God. <em>A</em> God is
less than man. True Christianity does not degrade
the Godhead, it exalts manhood, by bringing it back
near to God, as near as it is possible for the human
thought to approach the ineffable and inconceivable
Majesty of the true God.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>MS.</em>
</p>


<p>If I ventured to speak of God's purpose at all, I
should say, that it is not God's purpose to win
only the spiritually gifted, the humble, the tender
hearted, the souls that are discontented with their
own shortcomings, the souls that find happiness in
self-sacrifice&mdash;those are His already&mdash;but to win the
intellectually gifted, the wise, the cultivated, the
clever, or better still, to win them both. It would be
an evil day for Christianity if it could no longer win
the intellectually gifted, the wise, the cultivated, the
clever, and it seems to me the duty of all who really
believe in Christ to show that Christianity, if truly
understood, can win the highest as well as the
humblest intellects.</p>

<h2>DEATH</h2>


<p>Trust in God! What He does is well done.
What we are, we are through Him; what we
suffer, we suffer through His will. We cannot conceive
His wisdom, we cannot fathom His love; but
we can trust with a trust stronger than all other trusts
that He will not forsake us, when we cling to Him,
and call on Him, as His Son Jesus Christ has taught
us to call on Him, 'Our Father.' Though this
earthly form of ours must perish, all that was good,
and pure, and unselfish in us will live. Death has
no power over what is of God within us. Death
changes and purifies and perfects us, Death brings
us nearer to God, where we shall meet again those
that are God's, and love them with that godly love
which can never perish.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Life.</em>
</p>


<p>Would that loving Father begin such a work
in us as is now going on, and then destroy
it, leave it unfinished? No, what is will be; what
really is in us will always be; we shall be because
we are. Many things which are now will change,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
but what we really are we shall always be; and if love
forms really part of our very life, that love, changed it
may be, purified, sanctified, will be with us, and remain
with us through that greatest change which we call
death. The pangs of death will be the same for all
that, just as the pangs of childbirth seem ordained by
God in order to moderate the exceeding joy that a
child is born into the world. And as the pain is
forgotten when the child is born, so it will be after
death&mdash;the joy will be commensurate to the sorrow.
The sorrow is but the effort necessary to raise ourselves
to that new and higher state of being, and
without that supreme effort or agony, the new life
that waits for us is beyond our horizon, beyond our
conception. It is childish to try to anticipate, we
cannot know anything about it; we are meant to be
ignorant; even the <cite>Divina Commedia</cite> of a great poet
and thinker is but child's play, and nothing else....
No illusions, no anticipations; only that certainty,
that quiet rest in God, that submissive expectation
of the soul, which knows that all is good, all comes
from God, all tends to God.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>MS.</em>
</p>


<p>As one gets older death seems hardly to make so
wide a gap&mdash;a few years more or less, that
is all&mdash;meantime we know in whose hands we all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
are, that life is very beautiful, but death has its
beauty too.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Life.</em>
</p>


<p>We accustom ourselves so easily to life as a
second nature, and in spite of the graves
around us, death remains something unnatural, hard
and terrifying. That should not be. An early death
is terrifying, but as we grow older our thoughts
should accustom themselves to passing away at the
end of a long life's journey. All is so beautiful, so
good, so wisely ordered, that even death can be
nothing hard, nothing disturbing; it all belongs to a
great plan, which we do not understand, but of which
we know that it is wiser than all wisdom, better than
all good, that it cannot be otherwise, cannot be
better. In faith we can live and we can die&mdash;can
even see those go before us who came before us,
and whom we must follow. All is not according
to our will, to our wisdom, but according to a
heavenly will, and those who have once found each
other through God's hand will, clinging to His hand,
find each other again.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Life.</em>
</p>


<p>If we are called away sooner or later we ought to
part cheerfully, knowing that this earth could
give no more than has been ours, and looking forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
to our new home, as to a more perfect state where
all that was good and true and unselfish in us will
live and expand, and all that was bad and mean will
be purified and cast off. So let us work here as long
as it is day, but without fearing the night that will
lead us to a new and brighter dawn of life.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>MS.</em>
</p>


<p>Annihilation ... is a word without any
conceivable meaning. We are&mdash;that is enough.
What we are does not depend on us; what we shall
be neither. We may conceive the idea of change in
form, but not of cessation or destruction of substance.
People mean frequently by annihilation the loss of
conscious personality, as distinct from material annihilation.
What I feel about it is shortly this. If
there is anything real and substantial in our conscious
personality, then whatever there is real and substantial
cannot cease to exist. If on the contrary we
mean by conscious personality something that is the
result of accidental circumstances, then, no doubt, we
must face the idea of such a personality ceasing to be
what it now is. I believe, however, that the true
source and essence of our personality lies in what is
the most real of all real things, and in so far as it is
true, it cannot be destroyed. There is a distinction
between conscious personality and personal consciousness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
A child has personal consciousness, a man
who is this or that, a Napoleon, a Talleyrand, has
conscious personality. Much of that conscious personality
is merely temporary, and passes away, but
the personal consciousness remains.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Life.</em>
</p>


<p>One look up to heaven, and all this dust of the
highroad of life vanishes. Yes! one look up
to heaven and that dark shadow of death vanishes.
We have made the darkness of that shadow ourselves,
and our thoughts about death are very ungodly.
God has willed it so; there is to be a
change, and a change of such magnitude that even if
angels were to come down and tell us all about it, we
could not understand it, as little as the new-born child
would understand what human language could tell
about the present life. Think what the birth of a
child, of a human soul, is; and when you have felt
the utter impossibility of fathoming that mystery, then
turn your thoughts upon death, and see in it a new
birth equally unfathomable, but only the continuation of
that joyful mystery which we call a birth. It is all
God's work, and where is there a flaw in that wonder
of all wonders, God's ever-working work? If people
talk of the miseries of life, are they not all man's
work?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>


<p>Great happiness makes one feel so often that it
cannot last, and that we will have some day to
give up all to which one's heart clings so. A few years
sooner or later, but the time will come, and come
quicker than one expects. Therefore I believe it is
right to accustom oneself to the thought that we can
none of us escape death, and that all our happiness
here is only lent us. But at the same time we can
thankfully enjoy all that God gives us, ... and
there is still so much left us, so much to be happy
and thankful for, and yet here too the thought always
rushes across one's brightest hours: it cannot last, it
is only for a few years and then it must be given up.
Let us work as long as it is day, let us try to do our
duty, and be very thankful for God's blessings which
have been showered upon us so richly&mdash;but let us
learn also always to look beyond, and learn to be
ready to give up everything,&mdash;and yet say, Thy Will
be done.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>MS.</em>
</p>


<p>It is the most painful work I know looking through
the papers and other things belonging to one
who is no more with us. How different everything
looks to what it did before. There is one beautiful
feature about death, it carries off all the small faults of
the soul we loved, it makes us see the true littleness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
of little things, it takes away all the shadows, and
only leaves the light. That is how it ought to be;
and if in judging of a person we could only bring ourselves
to think how we should judge of them if we
saw them on the bed of death, how different life
would be! We always judge in self-defence, and
that makes our judgments so harsh. When they are
gone how readily we forget and forgive everything,
how truly we love all that was lovable in them, how
we blame ourselves for our own littleness in minding
this and that, and not simply and truly loving all that
was good and bright and noble. How different life
might be if we could all bring ourselves to be what
we really are, good and loving, and could blow away
the dust that somehow or other will fall on all of us.
It is never too late to begin again.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Life.</em>
</p>


<p>The death of those we love is the last lesson we
receive in life&mdash;the rest we must learn for
ourselves. To me, the older I grow, and the nearer
I feel that to me the end must be, the more perfect
and beautiful all seems to be; one feels surrounded
and supported everywhere by power, wisdom, and
love, content to trust and wait, incapable of murmuring,
very helpless, very weak, yet strong in that very
helplessness, because it teaches us to trust in something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
not ourselves. Yet parting with those we love
is hard&mdash;only I fear there is nothing else that would
have kept our eyes open to what is beyond this life.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>MS.</em>
</p>


<p>It is strange how little we all think of death as the
condition of all the happiness we enjoy now. If
we could but learn to value each hour of life, to enjoy
it fully, to use it fully, never to spoil a minute by
selfishness, then death would never come too soon;
it is the wasted hours which are like death in life, and
which make life really so short. It is not too late
to learn to try to be more humble, more forbearing,
more courteous, or, what is at the root of all, more
loving.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Life.</em>
</p>


<p>The great world for which we live seems to me as
good as the little world in which we live, and I
have never known why faith should fail, when everything,
even pain and sorrow, is so wonderfully good
and beautiful. All that we say to console ourselves
on the death of those we loved, and who loved us,
is hollow and false; the only true thing is rest and
silence. We cannot understand, and therefore we
must and can trust. There can be no mistake, no
gap, in the world-poem to which we belong; and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
believe that those stars which without their own contrivance
have met, will meet again. How, where,
when? God knows this, and that is enough.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>MS.</em>
</p>


<p>God has taught us that death is not so terrible as
it appears to most men&mdash;it is but a separation
for a few short days, and then, too, eternity awaits
us.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Life.</em>
</p>


<p>We live here in a narrow dwelling-house, which
presses us in on all sides, and yet we fancy
it is the whole universe. But when the door opens
and a loved one passes out, never to return, we too
step to the door and look out into the distance, and
realise then how small and empty the dwelling is, and
how a larger, more beautiful world waits for us
without. How it is in that larger world, who can
say? but if we were so happy in the narrow dwelling,
how far more happy shall we be out there! Be
not afraid. See how beautifully all is ordered; look
up to the widespread firmament, and think how small
it is in comparison with God's almighty power. He
who regulates the courses of the stars will regulate
the fate of the souls of men, and those souls who
have once met, shall they not meet again like the
stars?</p>

<p>Those who are absent are often nearer to us than
those who are present.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>MS.</em>
</p>


<p>We reckon too little with death, and then when
it comes it overwhelms us. We know all the
time that our friends must go, and that we must go,
but we shut our eyes, and enjoy their love and friendship
as if life could never end. We should say good-bye
to each other every evening&mdash;perhaps the last
good-bye would find us then less unprepared.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>MS.</em>
</p>


<p>There is something so natural in death. We
come and we go, there is no break.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Life.</em>
</p>


<p>What is more natural in life than death? and
having lived this long life, so full of light,
having been led so kindly by a Fatherly hand through
all storms and struggles, why should I be afraid when
I have to make the last step?</p>

<h2>THE DEITY</h2>


<p>We clearly see that the possibility of intercourse
between man and God, and a revelation of
God to man, depends chiefly or exclusively on the
conception which man has previously formed of God
and man. In all theological researches we must
carefully bear in mind that the idea of God is <em>our</em>
idea, which we have formed in part through tradition,
and in part by our own thinking. God is and remains
<em>our</em> God. We can have a knowledge of Him only
through our inner consciousness, not through our
senses.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Silesian Horseherd.</em>
</p>


<p>Our duties toward God and man, our love for
God and for man, are as nothing without the
firm foundation which is formed only by our faith in
God, as the Thinker and Ruler of the world, the
Father of the Son, who was revealed through Him
as the Father of all sons, of all men.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Silesian Horseherd.</em>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>


<p>Though Christianity has given us a purer and
truer idea of the Godhead, of the majesty of
His power and the holiness of His will, there remains
with many of us the conception of a merely objective
Deity. God is still with many of us in the clouds, so
far removed from the earth and so high above anything
human, that in trying to realise fully the
meaning of Christ's teaching we often shrink from
approaching too near to the blinding effulgence of
Jehovah. The idea that we should stand to Him in
the relation of children to their father seems to some
people almost irreverent, and the thought that God is
near us everywhere, the belief that we are also His
offspring, nay, that there has never been an absolute
barrier between divinity and humanity, has often been
branded as Pantheism. Yet Christianity would not be
Christianity without this so-called Pantheism, and it is
only some lingering belief in something like a Jove-like
Deus Optimus Maximus that keeps the eyes of our
mind fixed with awe on the God of Nature without,
rather than on the much more awful God of the soul
within.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Chips.</em>
</p>


<p>The idea of God is the result of an unbroken
historical evolution, call it a development, an
unveiling, or a purification, but not of a sudden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
revelation.... What right have we to find fault
with the manner in which the Divine revealed itself,
first to the eyes, and then to the mind, of man? Is the
revelation in nature really so contemptible a thing that
we can afford to despise it, or at the utmost treat it
as good enough for the heathen world? Our eyes
must have grown very dim, our mind very dull, if we
can no longer perceive how the heavens declare the
glory of God.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, II.</em>
</p>


<p>A belief in one Supreme God, even if at first it was
only a henotheistic, and not yet a monotheistic
belief, took possession of the leading spirits of the
Jewish race at a very early time. All tradition assigns
that belief in One God, the Most High, to Abraham.
Abraham, though he did not deny the existence of
the gods worshipped by the neighbouring tribes, yet
looked upon them as different from, and as decidedly
inferior to, his own God. His monotheism was, no
doubt, narrow. His God was the friend of Abraham,
as Abraham was the friend of God. Yet the concept
of God formed by Abraham was a concept that could
and did grow. Neither Moses, nor the Prophets, nor
Christ Himself, nor even Mohammed, had to introduce
a new God. Their God was always called the God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
of Abraham, even when freed from all that was local
and narrow in the faith of that patriarch.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, II.</em>
</p>


<p>To some any attempt to trace back the name and
concept of Jehovah to the same hidden sources
from which other nations derived their first intimation
of deity may seem almost sacrilegious. They forget
the difference between the human concept of the
Deity and the Deity itself, which is beyond the reach
of all human concepts. But the historian reads deeper
lessons in the growth of these human concepts, as
they spring up everywhere in the minds of men who
have been seekers after truth&mdash;seeking the Lord if
haply they might feel after Him and find Him&mdash;and
when he can show the slow but healthy growth of
the noblest and sublimest thoughts out of small and
apparently insignificant beginnings, he rejoices as the
labourer rejoices over his golden harvest; nay, he
often wonders what is more truly wonderful, the
butterfly that soars up to heaven on its silvery wings,
or the grub that hides within its mean chrysalis such
marvellous possibilities.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, II.</em>
</p>


<p>The concept of God arises out of necessity in the
human mind, and is not, as many theologians
will have it, the result of one special disclosure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
granted to Jews and Christians only. It seems to
me impossible to resist this conviction, where a
comparative study of the great religions of the
world shows us that the highest attributes which we
claim for the Deity are likewise ascribed to it by
the Sacred Books of other religions.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, II.</em>
</p>


<p>We can now repeat the words which have been
settled for us centuries ago, and which we
have learnt by heart in our childhood&mdash;I believe in
God the Father, Maker of heaven and earth&mdash;with the
conviction that they express, not only the faith of the
apostles, or of &oelig;cumenical councils, but that they
contain the Confession of Faith of the whole world,
expressed in different ways, conveyed in thousands of
languages, but always embodying the same fundamental
truth. I call it fundamental, because it is
founded, in the very nature of our mind, our reason,
and our language, on a simple and ineradicable conviction
that where there are acts there must be agents,
and in the end one Prime Agent, whom man may
know, not indeed in His own inscrutable essence, yet
in His acts, as revealed in Nature.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, II.</em>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>


<p>The historical proof of the existence of God, which
is supplied to us by the history of the religions
of the world, has never been refuted, and cannot be
refuted. It forms the foundation of all the other
proofs, call them cosmological, ontological, or teleological,
or rather it absorbs them all, and makes them
superfluous. There are those who declare that they
require no proof at all for the existence of a Supreme
Being, or if they did, they would find it in revelation,
and nowhere else. Suppose they wanted no proof
themselves, would they really not care at all to know
how the human race, and how they themselves, came
in possession of what, I suppose, they value as their
most precious inheritance? An appeal to revelation
is of no avail in deciding questions of this kind,
unless it is first explained what is really meant by
revelation. The history of religions teaches us that
the same appeal to a special revelation is made,
not only by Christianity, but by the defenders of
Brâhmanism, Zoroastrianism, and Mohammedanism,
and where is the tribunal to adjudicate on the conflicting
appeals of these and other claimants? The
followers of every one of these religions declare their
belief in the revealed character of their own religion,
never in that of any other religion. There is, no
doubt, a revelation to which we may appeal in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
court of our own conscience, but before the court of
universal appeal we require different proofs for the
faith that is in us.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, III.</em>
</p>


<p>Given man, such as he is, and given the world,
such as it is, a belief in divine beings, and, at
last, in one Divine Being, is not only a universal, but
an inevitable fact.... If from the standpoint of
human reason no flaw can be pointed out in the
intellectual process which led to the admission of
something within, behind, or beyond nature, call it
the Infinite or any other name you like, it follows
that the history of that process is really, at the same
time, the best proof of the legitimacy and truth of
the conclusions to which it has led.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, III.</em>
</p>


<p>There is no predicate in human language worthy
of God, all we can say of Him is what the
Upanishads said of Him, No, No! What does that
mean? It meant that if God is called all-powerful,
we have to say No, because whatever we comprehend
by powerful is nothing compared with the power
of God. If God is called all-wise, we have again to
say No, because what we call wisdom cannot approach
the wisdom of God. If God is called holy, again we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
have to say No, for what can our conception of
holiness be compared with the holiness of God?
This is what the thinkers of the Upanishads meant
when they said that all we can say of God is No, No.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, III.</em>
</p>


<p>If people would only define what they mean by
knowing, they would shrink from the very idea
that God can ever be known by us in the same sense
in which everything else is known, or that with
regard to Him we could ever be anything but
Agnostics. All human knowledge begins with the
senses, and goes on from sensations to percepts,
from percepts to concepts and names. And yet the
same people who insist that they know God, will
declare in the same breath that no one can see God
and live. Let us only define the meaning of knowing,
and keep the different senses in which this word has
been used carefully apart, and I doubt whether any
one would venture to say that, in the true sense of
the word, he is not an Agnostic as regards the true
nature of God. This silence before a nameless
Being does not exclude a true belief in God, nor
devotion, nor love of a Being beyond our senses,
beyond our understanding, beyond our reason, and
therefore beyond all names.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, III.</em>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>


<p>Every one of the names given to this infinite
Being by finite beings marks a stage in the
evolution of religious truth. If once we try to understand
these names, we shall find that they were all
well meant, that, for the time being, they were
probably the only possible names. The Historical
School does not look upon all the names given to
divine powers as simply true or simply false. We
look upon all of them as well meant and true for the
time being, as steps on the ladder on which the
angels of God ascend and descend. There was no
harm in the ancient people, when they were thirsting
for rain, invoking the sky, and saying, 'O, dear sky,
send us rain!' And when after a time they used
more and more general words, when they addressed
the powers (of nature) as bright, or rich, or mighty,
all these were meant for something else, for something
they were seeking for, if haply they might feel
after Him and find Him. This is St. Paul's view of
the growth of religion.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, III.</em>
</p>


<p>When God has once been conceived without 'any
manner of similitude,' He may be meditated
on, revered, and adored, but that fervent passion of
the human breast, that love with all our heart, and
all our soul, and all our might, seems to become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
hushed before that solemn presence. We may love
our father and mother with all our heart, we may
cling to our children with all our soul, we may be
devoted to wife, or husband, or friend with all our
might, but to throw all these feelings in their concentrated
force and truth on the Deity has been given
to very few on earth.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, III.</em>
</p>


<p>If the history of religion has taught us anything,
it has taught us to distinguish between the names
and the thing named. The names may change, and
become more and more perfect, and our concepts of
the Deity may become more perfect also, but the Deity
itself is not affected by our names. However much
the names may differ and change, there remains, as
the last result of the study of religion, the everlasting
conviction that behind all the names there is something
named, that there is an agent behind all acts,
that there is an Infinite behind the finite, that there
is a God in Nature. That God is the abiding goal
of many names, all well meant and well aimed, and
yet all far, far away from the goal which no man can
see and&mdash;live. All names that human language has
invented may be imperfect. But the name 'I am that
I am' will remain for those who think Semitic thought,
while to those who speak Aryan languages it will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
difficult to invent a better name than the Vedanta
Sa<em>k</em>-<em>k</em>id-ânanda, He who is, who knows, who is
blessed.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, III.</em>
</p>


<p>However much we may cease to speak the
language of the faith of our childhood, the
faith in a superintending and ever-present Providence
grows only stronger the more we see of life, the
more we know of ourselves. When that Bass-note
is right, we may indulge in many variations, we shall
never go entirely wrong.</p>

<p>We do not see the hand that takes our dear ones
from us, but we know whose hand it is,
whose will it is. We have no name for Him, we do
not know Him, but we know that whatever name we
give, He will understand it. That is the foundation
of all religion. Let us give the best name we can
find in us, let us know that even that must be a very
imperfect name, but let us trust that if we only believe
in that name, if we use it, not because it is the
fashion, but because we can find no better name, He
will understand and forgive. Every name is true
if we are true, every name is false if we are false.
If we are true our religion is true, if we are false our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
religion is false. An honest fetish worshipper even
is better than a scoffing Pope.</p>

<p class="sig">

</p>


<p>In the ordinary sense of knowledge we cannot have
any knowledge of God; our very idea of God
implies that He is beyond our powers of perception
and understanding. Then what can we do? Shut
our eyes and be silent? That will not satisfy
creatures such as we are. We must speak, but all
our words apply to things perceptible or intelligible.
The old Buddhists used to say, The only thing we can
say of God is No, No! He is not this, He is not that.
Whatever we can see or understand, He is not that.
But again I say that kind of self-denial will not satisfy
such creatures as we are. What can we do? We
can only give the best we have. Now the best we
have or know on earth is Love, therefore we say God
is Love or loving. Love is entire self-surrender, we
can go no further in our conception of what is best.
And yet how poor a name it is in comparison of what
we want to name. Our idea of love includes, as you
say, humility, a looking up and worshipping. Can
we say that of God's love? Depend upon it, the best
we say is but poor endeavour,&mdash;it is well we should
know it,&mdash;and yet, if it is the best we have and can
give, we need not be ashamed.</p>

<p>And now that generations after generations have
passed away, with their languages&mdash;adoring
and worshipping the Name of God&mdash;preaching and
dying in the Name of God&mdash;thinking and meditating
on the Name of God&mdash;there the old word stands still,
breathing to us the pure air of the dawn of humanity,
carrying with it all the thoughts and sighs, the doubts
and tears, of our bygone brethren, and still rising up
to heaven with the same sound from the basilicas of
Rome and the temples of Benares, as if embracing by
its simple spell millions and millions of hearts in their
longing desire to give utterance to the unutterable, to
express the inexpressible.</p>

<h2>THE DIVINE</h2>


<p>It was, after all, the Jew who, in the great history
of the world, was destined to solve the riddle of
the Divine in man. It was the soil of Jewish thought
that in the end gave birth to the true conception of
the relation between the Divine in nature and the
Divine in man.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, III.</em></p>


<p>When the Divine in the outward world has once
been fully recognised, there can be nothing
more or less divine, nothing more or less miraculous,
either in nature or in history. Those who assign a
divine and miraculous character to certain consecrated
events only in the history of the world, are in great
danger of desecrating thereby the whole drama of
history, and of making it, not only profane, but
godless. It is easy to call this a pantheistic view of
the world. It is pantheistic, in the best sense of the
word, so much so that any other view would soon
become atheistic. Even the Greeks suspected the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
omnipresence of the Divine, when, as early as the
time of Thales, they declared that <em>all</em> is full of the
gods. The choice here lies really between Pantheism
and Atheism. If anything, the greatest or the smallest,
can ever happen without the will of God, then
God is no longer God. To distinguish between a
direct and indirect influence of the Divine, to admit a
general and a special providence, is like a relapse into
polytheism, a belief in one and many gods.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, III.</em>
</p>


<p>Human nature is divine nature modified. It can
be nothing else. Christ, in shaking off all
that is not divine in man,&mdash;let us call it by one general
name, all that is selfish,&mdash;resumed His own divinity.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>MS.</em>
</p>


<p>God comes to us in the likeness of man&mdash;there is
no other likeness for God. And that likeness
is not forbidden, Christ has taught us to see and love
God in man. We cannot go further. If we attempt
to conceive anything more than human, our mind
breaks down. But we can conceive and perceive the
Divine in man, and most in those who are risen from
the earth. While we live our love is human, and
mixed with earthly things. We love and do not love&mdash;we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
even hate, or imagine we do. But we do not
really hate any man, we only hate something that
surrounds and hides man. What is behind, the true
nature of man, we always love. Death purifies man,
it takes away the earthly crust, and we can love those
who are dead far better than those who are still
living: that is the truth. We do not deceive ourselves,
we do not use vain words. Love is really
purer, stronger, and more unselfish when it embraces
those who are risen. That is why the Apostles loved
Christ so much better when He was no longer with
them. While He lived, Peter could deny Him&mdash;when
He had returned to the Father, Peter was willing to
die for Him. All that is so true, only one must have
gone through it, felt it oneself, in order to understand
it. If one knows the love one feels for the blessed,
one wants no temporary resurrection to account for
the rekindled love of the Apostles. They believed
that Christ had truly risen, that death had no power
over Him, that He was with the Father. Was not
that more, far more, than a return to this fleeting life
for a few hours, or days, or weeks, or than an ascent
through the clouds to the blue sky? Ah! how the
great truths have been exchanged for small fancies,
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mira</i> for the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">miracula</i>.</p>

<h2>DOUBTS</h2>


<p>There is certainly no happier life than a life of
simple faith; of literal acceptance, of rosy
dreams. We must all grant that, if it were possible,
nothing would be more perfect. I gladly acknowledge
that some of the happiest, and also some of the best
men and women I have known, were those who
would have shrunk with horror from questioning a
single letter of the Bible, or doubting that a serpent
actually spoke to Eve, and an ass to Balaam. But can
we prevent the light of the sun and the noises of the
street from waking the happy child from his heavenly
dreams? Nay, is it not our duty to wake the child,
when the time has come that he must be up and
doing, and take his share in the toils of the day?
And is it not well for those who for the first time
open their eyes and look around, that they should see
by their side some who have woke before them, who
understand their inquiring looks, and can answer their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
timid questions and tell them in the simple-hearted
language of the old poet:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'There lives more faith in honest doubt,</span>
<span class="i0">Believe me, than in half the creeds.'</span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, III.</em>
</p>


<p>There is an atheism which is unto death, there is
another atheism which is the life-blood of all
true faith. It is the power of giving up what, in our
best, our most honest, moments, we know to be no
longer true; it is the readiness to replace the less
perfect, however dear, however sacred it may have
been to us, by the more perfect, however much it may
be detested, as yet, by the world. It is the true self-surrender,
the true self-sacrifice, the truest trust in
truth, the truest faith. Without that atheism religion
would long ago have become a petrified hypocrisy;
without that atheism no new religion, no reform, no
reformation, no resuscitation would ever have been
possible; without that atheism no new life is possible
for any one of us.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Hibbert Lectures.</em>
</p>


<p>How many men in all countries and all ages have
been called atheists, not because they denied
that there existed anything beyond the visible and the
finite, or because they declared that the world, such as
it was, could be explained without a cause, without a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
purpose, without a God, but often because they
differed only from the traditional conception of the
Deity prevalent at the time, and were yearning after a
higher conception of God than what they had learnt
in their childhood.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Hibbert Lectures.</em>
</p>


<p>There are moments in our life when those who
seek most earnestly after God think they are
forsaken of God; when they hardly venture to ask
themselves, Do I then believe in God, or do I not?
Let them not despair, and let us not judge harshly of
them; their despair may be better than many creeds....
Honest doubt is the deepest spring of honest
faith; only he who has lost can find.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Hibbert Lectures.</em>
</p>


<p>If we have once claimed the freedom of the spirit
which St. Paul claimed: to prove all things and
hold fast that which is good: we cannot turn back,
we cannot say that no one shall prove our own
religion, no one shall prove other religions and compare
them with our own. We have to choose once
for all between freedom and slavery of judgment, and
though I do not wish to argue with those who prefer
slavery, yet one may remind them that even they, in
deliberately choosing slavery, follow their own private<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
judgment quite as much as others do in choosing
freedom.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, III.</em>
</p>


<p>Our own self-interest surely would seem to
suggest as severe a trial of our own religion as
of other religions, nay, even a more severe trial. Our
religion has sometimes been compared to a good ship
that is to carry us through the waves and tempests of
this life to a safe haven. Would it not be wise, therefore,
to have it tested, and submitted to the severest
trials, before we entrust ourselves and those dear to us
to such a vessel. And remember, all men, except
those who take part in the foundation of a new
religion, or have been converted from an old to a new
faith, have to accept their religious belief on trust,
long before they are able to judge for themselves.
And while in all other matters an independent judgment
in riper years is encouraged, every kind of
influence is used to discourage a free examination of
religious dogmas, once engrafted on our intellect in
its tenderest stage. We condemn an examination of
our own religion, even though it arises from an
honest desire to see with our own eyes the truth
which we mean to hold fast; and yet we do not
hesitate to send missionaries into all the world, asking
the faithful to re-examine their own time-honoured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
religions. We attack their most sacred convictions, we
wound their tenderest feelings, we undermine the
belief in which they have been brought up, and we
break up the peace and happiness of their homes.
Yet if some learned Jew, or subtle Brahman, or outspoken
Zulu asks us to re-examine the date and
authorship of the Old or New Testament, or challenges
us to produce the evidence on which we also
are quite ready to accept certain miracles, we are
offended, forgetting that with regard to these questions
we can claim no privilege, no immunity.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, III.</em>
</p>


<p>If we can respect a childlike and even a childish
faith, we ought likewise to learn to respect even
a philosophical atheism which often contains the
hidden seeds of the best and truest faith. We ought
never to call a man an atheist, and say that he does
not believe in God, till we know what kind of God it
is he has been brought up to believe in, and what
kind of God it is that he rejects, it may be, from the
best and highest motives. We ought never to forget
that Socrates was called an atheist, that the early
Christians were all called atheists, that some of the
best and greatest men this world has ever known have
been branded by that name.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, III.</em>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>


<p>I have heard and read the worst that can be said
against our religion&mdash;I mean the true original
teaching of Christ&mdash;and I feel that I am ready in
mind, if not in body, to lay down my life for the
truth of His teaching. All our difficulties arise from
the doctrines of men, not from His doctrine. There
is no outward evidence of the truth of His doctrine,
but the Spirit of God that is within us testifieth to its
truth. If it does not, we are not yet disciples of
Christ, but we may be hereafter.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Life.</em>
</p>


<p>Be certain of this, that to repress a doubt is to
repress the spirit of truth; a doubt well spoken
out is generally a doubt solved. But all this requires
great seriousness of mind&mdash;it must assume an importance
greater than anything else in life, and then
we can fight our way through it. God is with us in
our struggles.</p>

<h2>EVOLUTION OF RELIGION</h2>


<p>Evolution is really the same as history, if we
take it in its objective sense. Subjectively,
history meant originally inquiry, or a desire to know;
it then came to mean knowledge, obtained by inquiry,
and lastly, in a purely objective sense, the objects of
such knowledge.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, I.</em>
</p>


<p>We may discover in all the errors of mythology,
and in what we call the false or pagan
religions of this world, a progress towards truth, a
yearning after something more than finite, a growing
recognition of the Infinite, throwing off some of its
veils before our eyes, and from century to century
revealing itself to us more and more in its own
purity and holiness. And thus the two concepts,
that of evolution and that of revelation, which seem
at first so different, become one in the end. If there
is a purpose running through the ages, if nature is
not blind, if there are agents, recognised at last as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the agents of one Will, behind the whole phenomenal
world, then the evolution of man's belief in that
Supreme Will is itself the truest revelation of that
Supreme Will, and must remain the adamantine
foundation on which all religion rests, whether we
call it natural or supernatural.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, II.</em>
</p>


<p>The same changes in the idea of God, which we
see in the different books of the Bible, take
place in the different chapters of our own life. The
child cannot but represent God to himself as a
venerable man, walking about, warning and reproving
the creatures He has made. The child has no higher
conception as yet which it could apply to God; if it
heard of a higher one it could not grasp it. But as
the child grows and gathers in higher conceptions,
the lower must give way to the higher. As long as
the evidence of the senses is the only evidence which
a child knows, he demands a visible God. When he
learns that the human senses are different modes of
apprehension, that according to their very nature they
can never apprehend except what is limited, then
the mind involuntarily surrenders the visible God, it
believes in God as a Spirit. And so the growth of
each man, and the growth of the whole human race,
goes on, and will go on; and I cannot see how, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the world goes on as it has hitherto, it can be otherwise
but that much of the language of the New
Testament also will have to be surrendered. Changes
have lately taken place with the word <em>person</em>. Many
things which were formerly comprehended under
personality have been discovered to be mere accessories,
and above the more material conception of
personality, of individuality, or of the I, a higher
one is rising, that of the <em>Self</em>. The I, the personality,
is made up of many things which are purely temporal&mdash;which
are dear to us on earth, but which will pass
away, while the Self will abide for ever. Need we
wonder, therefore, that just those who wish to transfer
only their highest to the Godhead begin to shrink
from speaking of a personal God? or insist on
defining the word 'personal' so that it should exclude
all that is incompatible with a perfect, unlimited,
unchanging Being? What led to such expressions
as 'God is Love' but a feeling of reverence, which
shrank from speaking of God as loving as we love?
This process will go on as long as the thoughts and
words of mankind grow and change. Let us learn
only from the Bible that those who spoke of God as
walking about in Paradise spoke as children, did the
best they could, gave all they had, and who shall say
that their two mites were in the sight of God less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
precious than all our creeds and philosophies? They
too will change, they too will be looked upon by
future generations as the language of children. But
He to whom our thoughts and prayers are addressed
will interpret all languages and dialects. Before Him
the wisdom of the man will not sound much wiser
than the trustful ignorance of the child.</p>

<h2>FAITH</h2>


<p>Next to our faith in God there is nothing so
essential to the healthy growth of our whole
being as an unshaken faith in man.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Chips.</em>
</p>


<p>Let us trust in Him to whom alone we owe all
our blessings. If we do not forsake Him, He
will never forsake us&mdash;we cannot fathom His love,
but we can trust.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>MS.</em>
</p>


<p>Separation loses its bitterness when we have
faith in each other and in God. Faith in each
other keeps us close together in life, and faith in God
keeps us together in eternity.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>MS.</em>
</p>


<p>Those who remember the happiness of the simple
faith of their childhood may well ask why it
should ever be disturbed. Knowing the blessedness
of that faith we naturally abstain from everything
that might disturb it prematurely in the minds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
those who are entrusted to us. But, as the child,
whether he likes it or not, grows to be a man, so
the faith of a child grows into the faith of a man. It
is not our doing, it is the work of Him who made
us what we are. As all our other ideas grow and
change, so does our idea of God. I know there are
men and women who, when they perceive the first
warnings of that inward growth, become frightened
and suppress it with all their might. They shut their
eyes and ears to all new light from within and from
without. They wish to remain as happy as children,
and many of them succeed in remaining as good as
children. Who would blame them or disturb them?
But those who trust in God and God's work within
them, must go forth to the battle. With them it
would be cowardice and faithlessness to shrink from
the trial. They are not certain that they were meant
to be here simply to enjoy the happiness of a childlike
faith. They feel they have a talent committed
to them which must not be wrapped up in a napkin.
But the battle is hard, and all the harder because,
while they know they are obeying the voice of truth,
which is the voice of God, many of those whom they
love look upon them as disobeying the voice of God,
as disturbers of the peace, as giving offence to those
little ones.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>MS.</em>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>


<p>There is a difference between the childlike faith
of a man (all real faith must be childlike) and
the childlike faith of a child. The one is Paradise
not yet lost, the other Paradise lost but regained.
The one is right for the child, the other is right for
the man. It is the will of God that it should be so&mdash;but
it is also the will of God that we should all bear
with each other, and join, each in his own voice, in
the great hymn of praise.</p>

<p>Faith is that organ of knowledge by which we
apprehend the Infinite, namely, whatever transcends
the ken of our senses and the grasp of our
reason. The Infinite is hidden from the senses, it is
denied by Reason, but it is perceived by Faith; and
it is perceived, if once perceived, as underlying both
the experience of the senses and the combinations of
reason.</p>

<p>Man must discover that God is his father before
he can become a son of God. To know is
here to be, to be to know. No mere miracle will
make man the son of God. That sonship can be
gained through knowledge only, 'through man knowing
God, or rather being known of God,' and till it
is so gained it does not exist, even though it be a
fact. If we apply this to the words in which Christ
speaks of Himself as the Son of God, we shall see
that to Him it is no miracle, it is no mystery, it is
no question of supernatural contrivance; it is simply
clear knowledge, and it was this self-knowledge which
made Christ what He was, it was this which constituted
His true, His eternal divinity.</p>

<h2>FUTURE LIFE</h2>


<p>One wonders indeed how kindred souls become
separated, and one feels startled and repelled
at the thought that, such as they were on earth, they
can never meet again. And yet there is continuity
in the world, there is no flaw, no break anywhere,
and what has been will surely be again, though how
it will be we cannot know, and if only we trust in
the Wisdom that pervades and overshadows the whole
Universe, we need not know.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Auld Lang Syne.</em>
</p>


<p>Even if we resign ourselves to the thought that
the likenesses and likelihoods which we project
upon the unseen and unknown, nay, that the hope
of our meeting again as we once met on earth, need
not be fulfilled exactly as we shape them to ourselves,
where is the argument to make us believe that the
real fulfilment can be less perfect than what even a
weak human heart devises and desires? This trust
that whatever is will be best, is what is meant by faith,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
true, because inevitable, faith. We see traces of it in
many places and many religions, but I doubt whether
anywhere that faith is more simply and more powerfully
expressed than in the Old and New Testaments:
'For since the beginning of the world men have not
heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the
eye seen, O God, beside Thee, what He hath prepared
for him that waiteth for Him' (Isaiah lxiv. 4).
'As it is written, Eye hath not seen nor ear heard,
neither have entered into the heart of man, the things
which God hath prepared for them that love Him'
(1 Cor. ii. 9).</p>

<p class="sig">

<p>The highest which man can comprehend is man.
One step only he may go beyond, and say that
what is beyond may be different, but it cannot be less
perfect than the present; the future cannot be worse
than the past.... That much-decried philosophy of
evolution, if it teaches us anything, teaches us a firm
belief in a better future, and in a higher perfection
which man is destined to reach.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Hibbert Lectures.</em>
</p>


<p>In our longings for the departed we often think of
them as young or old, we think of them as man
or woman, as father or mother, as husband or wife.
Even nationality and language are supposed to remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
after death, and we often hear expressions, 'Oh! if
the souls are without all this, without age, and sex,
and national character, without even their native
language, what will they be to us?' The answer is,
They will really be the same to us they were in this
life. Unless we can bring ourselves to believe that a
soul has a beginning, and that our soul sprang into
being at the time of our birth, the soul within us must
have existed before. But however convinced we may
be of the soul's eternal existence, we shall always
remain ignorant as to how it existed. And yet we
do not murmur or complain. Our soul on awakening
here is not quite a stranger to itself, and the souls
who, as our parents, our wives, and husbands, our
children, and our friends, have greeted us at first as
strangers in this life, have become to us as if we had
known them for ever, and as if we could never lose
them again. If it were to be so again in the next life,
if there also we should meet at first as strangers till
drawn together by the same mysterious love that has
drawn us together here, why should we murmur or
complain? Thousands of years ago we read of a
husband telling his wife, 'Verily a wife is not dear
that you may love the wife, but that you may love
the soul, therefore a wife is dear.' What does that
mean? It means that true love consists not in loving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
what is perishable, but in discovering and loving what
is eternal in man or woman. In Sanscrit that eternal
part is called by many names, but the best seems that
used in this passage, Atma. We translate it by Soul,
but it is even higher and purer than Soul, it is best
translated by the word <em>Self</em>. That which constitutes
the true Self, the looker-on, the witness within us,
that which is everywhere in the body and yet nowhere
to be touched, that which cannot die or expire,
because it never breathed, that is the Infinite in man
which philosophers have been groping for, though
'he is not far from every one of us.' It is the Divine
or God-like in man.</p>

<p>The southern Aryans were absorbed in the
struggles of thought: their past is the problem
of creation, their future the problem of existence, and
the present, which ought to be the solution of both,
seems never to have attracted their attention, or called
forth their energies. There never was a nation
believing so firmly in another world, and so little
concerned about this. Their condition on earth was
to them a problem; their real and eternal life a simple
fact. Though this is true chiefly before they were
brought in contact with foreign conquerors, traces of
this character are still visible in the Hindus as described<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
by the companions of Alexander, nay, even in the
Hindus of the present day. The only sphere in which
the Indian mind finds itself at liberty to act, to create,
and to worship is the sphere of religion and philosophy,
and nowhere have religious and metaphysical
ideas struck root so deeply in the mind of a nation as
in India. History supplies no second instance where
the inward life of the soul has so completely absorbed
all the other faculties of a people.</p>

that. We shall be called away, but we shall meet

<p>We must have patience&mdash;and we all cling to life
as long as there are those who love us here.
Those who love us there are always ours. Nothing
is lost in the world. How it will be, we know not,

wisdom and love here on earth, we can take comfort,
and wait patiently for that which is to come.</p>

Why not? It is really here on earth that those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
whom we love change, it is here that they die every
day.... Where are all those bright joyous faces
which we look at when we open our photograph
books from year to year? On earth they are lost,
but are they not treasured up for another life, where
we shall be not only what we are from day to day,
never the same to-morrow as we were yesterday, but
where we are at once all that we can be&mdash;where
memory is not different from perception, nor our
wills different from our acts? We shall soon know&mdash;till
then surely we have a right to be what we are,
and to cling to our human hopes. The more human
they are, the nearer the truth they are likely to be.</p>

<p>I believe in all our hopes we cannot be human

hopes are human, but what are the doubts and difficulties?
Are they not human too? Shall we meet
again as we left? Why not? We do not know <em>how</em>
it will be so, but who has a right to say it <em>cannot</em>
be so? Let us imagine and hope for the best that, as

it will be a thousand times better.</p>

<p>The inward voice never suggested or allowed me
the slightest doubt or misgiving about the
reality of a future life. If there is continuity in the
world everywhere, why should there be a wrench and
annihilation only with us? It will be as it has been&mdash;that
is the lesson we learn from nature&mdash;<em>how</em> it will
be we are not meant to know. There is an old Greek
saying to the effect, to try to know what the gods did
not tell us is not piety. If God wished us to know
what is to be, He would tell us. Darwin has shown
us that there is continuity from beginning to end.</p>

<p class="sig">

<p>I believe in the continuity of Self. If there were
an annihilation or complete change of our individual
self-consciousness, we might become somebody
else, but we should not be ourselves. Personally, I
have no doubt of the persistence of the individual after
death, as we call it. I cannot imagine the very crown
and flower of creation being destroyed by its author.
I do not say it is impossible, it is not for us to say
either yes or no; we have simply to trust, but that
trust or faith is implanted in us, and is strengthened
by everything around us.</p>

<p>Do we really lose those who are called before us?
I feel that they are even nearer to us than when
they were with us in life. We must take a larger
view. Our life does not end here, if only we can see
that our horizon here is but like a curtain that separates
us from what is beyond. Those who go before us
are beyond our horizon at present, but we have no
right to suppose that they have completely vanished.
We cannot see them, that is all. And even that, we
know, can last for a short time only. We have lived
and done our work in life, before we knew those we
loved, and we may have to live the same number of
years separated from them. But nothing can be lost:
it depends on ourselves to keep those we loved always
near to our thoughts, even though our eyes look in
vain for them. The world is larger than this little
earth, our thoughts go further than this short life, and
if we can but find our home in this larger world, we
shall find that this larger home is full of those whom
we loved, and who loved us. There is no <em>chance</em> in life;
a few years more, a few years less, will seem as
nothing to us hereafter.</p>

Christ will be my guide and helper, and bring me to
a better life, and unite me again with those whom I
have loved, and whom I love still, and those who
have loved me and love me still. God is no giver of
imperfect gifts, and He has given me life, but life on
earth is imperfect. He has given me love, but love
on earth is imperfect. I believe, I must believe in

<p>It seems hard, it seems so unintelligible, so far above
us, that we should know nothing at all of what
is to come&mdash;that we should be so completely separated
for a time from those whom we love. Whence all
these limits? whence all those desires in us that cannot
be fulfilled? The limits teach us one lesson, that we
are in the Hands of a Higher Power. Wonderful as
our body and our senses are, they are a prison and
chains, and they could not be meant for anything
else.</p>

<p>Of what is to come, what is in store for us, we

it cannot be wrong. Why was the past often so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
beautiful? Because all tends to beauty, to perfection,
and the highest point of perfection is love. We are
far from that here, yet all the miseries of this life, or
many at least, would vanish before love. Life seems
most unnatural in what we call the most highly
civilised countries&mdash;the struggle of life is fiercest
there. Rest and love seem impossible, and yet that
is what we are yearning for, and it may be granted
us hereafter.</p>

<p>How is it that we know so little of life after

we are to believe the best we can believe, and yet all
is earthly, human, weak. We are in a dark prison
here; let us believe that outside it there is no darkness,
but light&mdash;but what light, who knows?</p>

and flowers, and all the rest. And why should it be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
so different when the door opens, and we step out of
this dark life into the bright room? Why should all
be different? We have stepped into this dark room
here on earth, and how often did we think it was
very bright and very warm. We shall step into
another room, and it will be brighter, warmer, more

we shall have the past again,&mdash;for the past is not
lost. Nothing is lost&mdash;but this waiting is sometimes
very hard, and this longing very hard. Friends go on

to do, and there is much left to love.</p>

<p>If immortality is meant for no more than a continuance
of existence, if by a belief in immortality
on the part of the Jews is meant no more
than that the Jews did not believe in the annihilation
of the soul at the time of death, we may confidently
assert that, to the bulk of the Jewish nation, this very
idea of annihilation was as yet unfamiliar. The fact
is that the idea of absolute annihilation and nothingness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
is hardly ever found except among people whose
mind has received some amount of philosophical
education, certainly more than what the Jews possessed
in early times. The Jews did not believe in
the utter destruction of the soul, but, on the other
hand, their idea of life after death was hardly that of
life at all. It was existence without life. Death was
considered by them, as by the Greeks, as the greatest
of misfortunes. To rejoice in death is a purely
Christian, not a Jewish, idea. Though the Jews
believed that the souls continued to exist in Sheol,
they did not believe that the wicked would there be
punished and the good rewarded. All rewards and
punishments for virtue or vice were confined to this
world, and a long life was regarded as a sure proof of
the favour of Jehovah. It was the Jewish conception
of God, as infinitely removed from this world, that
made a belief in true immortality almost impossible
for them, and excluded all hope for a nearer approach
to God, or for any share in that true immortality
which belonged to Him and to Him alone.</p>

earth and fill them with longing for our true home.
They lighten the burden of life, they give a quiet,
gentle tone to the joys of life, and they teach us to
love those who are left to us on earth, it may be but
for a few days or years, with a love which we never
knew before, a love which bears all things, believes all
things, and gladly pardons all things.</p>

<h2>THE INFINITE</h2>


<p>Though we cannot know things finite, as they
are in themselves, we know at all events that
they are. And this applies to our perception of the
Infinite also. We do not know through our senses
what it is, but we know through our very senses
that it is. We feel the pressure of the Infinite in the
Finite, and unless we had that feeling, we should have
no true and safe foundation for whatever we may
afterwards believe of the Infinite. Some critics
have urged that what I call the Infinite ... is the
Indefinite only. Of course it is.... We can
know the Infinite as the Indefinite only, or as the
partially defined. We try to define it, and to know
it more and more, but we never finish it. The whole
history of religion represents the continuous progress
of the human definition of the Infinite, but however
far that definition may advance, it will never exhaust
the Infinite. Could we define it all, it would cease
to be the Infinite, it would cease to be the Unknown,
it would cease to be the Inconceivable or the Divine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>


<p>What we feel through the pressure on all our
senses is the pressure of the Infinite. Our
senses, if I may say so, feel nothing but the Infinite,
and out of that plenitude they apprehend the Finite.
To apprehend the Finite is the same as to define the
Infinite.</p>

<p>We accept the primitive savage with nothing but
his five senses. These five senses supply
him with a knowledge of finite things; the problem
is how such a being ever comes to think or speak
of anything not finite, but infinite. It is his senses
which give him the first impression of infinite things,
and force him to the admission of the infinite. Everything
of which his senses cannot perceive a limit is to
a primitive savage, or to any man in an early stage
of intellectual activity, unlimited or infinite. Man
sees to a certain point, and there his eyesight breaks
down. But exactly where his eyesight breaks down,
there presses upon him, whether he likes it or not,
the perception of the unlimited or infinite. It may
be said this is not perception in the ordinary sense
of the word. No more it is, but still less is it mere
reasoning. In perceiving the infinite, we neither
count, nor measure, nor compare, nor name. We
know not what it is, but we know that it is, and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
know it because we actually feel it and are brought
in contact with it. If it seems too bold to say that
man actually sees the invisible, let us say that he suffers
from the invisible, and this invisible is only a special
name for the infinite. The infinite, therefore, instead
of being merely a late abstraction, is really implied in
the earliest manifestations of our sensuous knowledge.
It was true from the very first, but it was not yet
defined or named. If the infinite had not from the
very first been present in our sensuous perceptions,
such a word as infinite would be a sound and nothing
else. With every finite perception there is a concomitant
perception or a concomitant sentiment or presentiment
of the infinite; from the very first act of touch,
or hearing, or sight, we are brought in contact, not
only with the visible, but also at the same time with an
invisible universe. We have in this that without which
no religion would have been possible, we have in that
perception of the infinite the root of the whole historical
development of religion.</p>

<p>The idea of the infinite, which is at the root of all
religious thought, is not simply evolved by
reason out of nothing, but supplied to us, in its
original form, by our senses. Beyond, behind, beneath,
and within the finite, the infinite is always
present to our senses. It presses upon us, it grows
upon us from every side. What we call finite in
space and time, in form and word, is nothing but a
veil or a net which we ourselves have thrown over
the infinite. The finite by itself, without the infinite,
is simply inconceivable; as inconceivable as the infinite
without the finite. As reason deals with the
finite materials supplied to us by our senses, faith, or
whatever else we like to call it, deals with the infinite
that underlies the finite. What we call sense, reason,
and faith are three functions of one and the same
perceptive self; but without sense both reason and
faith are impossible, at least to human beings like ourselves.</p>

<p>The ancestors of our race did not only believe in
divine powers more or less manifest to their
senses, in rivers and mountains, in the sky and the
sun, in the thunder and rain, but their senses likewise
suggested to them two of the most essential elements
of all religion: the concept of the infinite, and the concept
of law and order, as revealed before them, the
one in the golden sea behind the dawn, the other in
the daily path of the sun.... These two concepts,
which sooner or later must be taken in and minded by
every human being, were at first no more than an
impulse, but their impulsive force would not rest till it
had beaten into the minds of the fathers of our race
the deep and indelible impression that 'all is right,'
and filled them with a hope, and more than a hope,
that 'all will be right.'</p>

<p>All objects which we perceive and afterwards
conceive and name must be circumscribed, must
have been separated from their surroundings, must be
measurable, and can thus only become perceivable and
knowable and namable.... They are therefore finite
in their very nature.... If finiteness is a necessary
characteristic of our ordinary knowledge, it requires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
but little reflection to perceive that limitation or finiteness,
in whatever sense we use it, always implies a
something beyond. We are told that our mind is so
constituted, whether it is our fault or not, that we
cannot conceive an absolute limit. Beyond every limit
we must always take it for granted that there is something
else. But what is the reason of this? The
reason why we cannot conceive an absolute limit is
because we never perceive an absolute limit; or in
other words, because in perceiving the finite we
always perceive the infinite also.... There is no
limit which has not two sides, the one turned towards
us, the other turned towards what is beyond; and it
is that Beyond which from the earliest days has
formed the only real foundation of all that we call
transcendental in our perceptual, as well as in our conceptual,
Knowledge.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, I.</em>
</p>


<p>The infinite was not discovered behind the veil of
nature only, though its manifestation in physical
phenomena was no doubt the most primitive and the
most fertile source of mythological and religious ideas.
There were two more manifestations of the infinite
and the unknown, which must not be neglected, if we
wish to gain a complete insight into the theogonic
process through which the human mind had to pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
from its earliest days. The infinite disclosed itself
not only in nature but likewise in man, looked upon as
an object, and lastly in man looked upon as a subject.
Man looked upon as an object, as a living thing, was
felt to be more than a mere part of nature. There
was something in man, whether it was called breath
or spirit or soul or mind, which was perceived and yet
not perceived, which was behind the veil of the body,
and from a very early time was believed to remain
free from decay, even when illness and death had
destroyed the body in which it seemed to dwell.
There was nothing to force even the simplest peasant
to believe that because he saw his father dead, and his
body decaying, therefore what was known as the man
himself, call it his soul or his mind or his person, had
vanished altogether out of existence. A philosopher
may arrive at such an idea, but a man of ordinary
understanding, though terrified by the aspect of death,
would rather be inclined to believe that what he had
known and loved and called his father or mother
must be somewhere, though no longer in the body....
It is perhaps too much to say that such a belief
was universal; but it certainly was and is still very
widely spread. In fact it constitutes a very large
portion of religion and religious worship.</p>

<p>Nature, Man, and Self are the three great manifestations
in which the infinite in some shape
or other has been perceived, and every one of these
perceptions has in its historical development contributed
to what may be called religion.</p>

<p class="sig">

<p>Like all other experiences, our religious experience
begins with the senses. Though the senses
seem to deliver to us finite experiences only, many, if
not all, of them can be shown to involve something
beyond the Known, something unknown, something
which I claim the liberty to call infinite. In this way
the human mind was led to the recognition of undefined,
infinite agents or agencies beyond, behind,
and within our finite experience. The feelings of
fear, awe, reverence, and love excited by the manifestations
of some of these agents or powers began to
react on the human mind, and thus produced what we
call Natural Religion in its lowest and simplest form&mdash;fear,
awe, reverence, and love of the gods.</p>

forget that, like every other concept, that of the
Infinite also had to pass through many phases in its
historical evolution, beginning with the simple negation
of what is finite, and the assertion of an invisible
Beyond, and leading up to a perceptive belief in that
most real Infinite in which we live and move and
have our being.</p>

to adopt the more moderate language of Kant, the
knowledge of the limits of our knowledge.</p>

arch in the <cite>Veda</cite>, its last in Kant's <cite>Critique of Pure
Reason</cite>. In the <cite>Veda</cite> we watch the first unfolding of
the human mind as we can watch it nowhere else.
Life seems simple, natural, childlike.... What is
beneath, and above, and beyond this life is dimly perceived,
and expressed in a thousand words and ways,
all mere stammerings, all aiming to express what
cannot be expressed, yet all full of a belief in the real
presence of the Divine in Nature, of the Infinite in the
Finite.... While in the <cite>Veda</cite> we may study the
childhood, we may study in Kant's <cite>Critique</cite> the
perfect manhood of the Aryan mind. It has passed
through many phases, and every one of them ... has
left its mark. It is no longer dogmatical, no longer
sceptical, least of all is it positive.... It stands
before us conscious of its weakness and its strength,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
modest yet brave. It knows what the old idols of its
childhood and youth were made of. It does not
break them, it only tries to understand them, but it
places above them the Ideals of Reason&mdash;no longer
tangible&mdash;not even within the reach of the understanding&mdash;but
real&mdash;bright and heavenly stars to
guide us even in the darkest night.</p>

<p>All knowledge, in order to be knowledge, must
pass through two gates, and two gates only:
the gate of the senses and the gate of reason.
Religious knowledge also, whether true or false, must
have passed through these two gates. At these two
gates, therefore, we take our stand. Whatever claims
to have entered in by any other gate, whether that
gate is called primeval revelation or religious instinct,
must be rejected as contraband of thought; and whatever
claims to have entered by the gate of reason,
without having first passed through the gate of the
senses, must equally be rejected, as without sufficient
warrant, or ordered at least to go back to the first
gate, in order to produce there its full credentials.</p>

<h2>LANGUAGE</h2>


<p>The history of language opens a vista which makes
one feel almost giddy if one tries to see the
end of it, but the measuring-rod of the chronologist
seems to me entirely out of place. Those who have
eyes to see will see the immeasurable distance between
the first historical appearance of language and the real
beginnings of human speech: those who cannot see
will oscillate between the wildly large figures of the
Buddhists, or the wildly small figures of the Rabbis,
but they will never lay hold of what by its very nature
is indefinite.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Life.</em>
</p>


<p>By no effort of the understanding, by no stretch
of imagination, can I explain to myself how
language could have grown out of anything which
animals possess, even if we granted them millions of
years for that purpose. If anything has a right to
the name of specific difference, it is language, as we
find it in man, and in man only. Even if we removed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
the name of specific difference from our philosophic
dictionaries, I should still hold that nothing deserves
the name of man except what is able to speak.</p>

<p>Every language has to be learnt, but who made
the language that was to be learnt? It matters
little whether we call language an instinct, a gift, a
talent, a faculty, or the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">proprium</i> of man; certain it
is that neither language, nor the power of language,
nor the conditions under which alone language can
exist, are to be discovered anywhere in the whole
animal kingdom, except in man.</p>

<p>It was Christianity which first broke down the
barrier between Jew and Gentile, between Greek
and Barbarian, between the white and the black.
<em>Humanity</em> is a word which you look for in vain in
Plato and Aristotle; the idea of mankind as one
family, as the children of one God, is an idea of
Christian growth; and the science of mankind, and
of the languages of mankind, is a science which,
without Christianity, would never have sprung into
life. When people had been taught to look upon
all men as brethren, then, and then only, did the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
variety of human speech present itself as a problem
that called for a solution in the eyes of thoughtful
observers; and from an historical point of view it
is not too much to say that the first day of Pentecost
marks the real beginning of the science of language.</p>

<p>And now, if we gaze from our native shores over
the vast ocean of human speech, with its waves
rolling on from continent to continent, rising under
the fresh breezes of the morning of history, and
slowly heaving in our own more sultry atmosphere,
with sails gliding over its surface, and many an oar
ploughing through its surf, and the flags of all nations
waving joyously together, with its rocks and wrecks,
its storms and battles, yet reflecting serenely all that
is beneath and above and around it; if we gaze and
hearken to the strange sounds rushing past our ears
in unbroken strains, it seems no longer a wild tumult,
but we feel as if placed within some ancient cathedral,
listening to a chorus of innumerable voices: and the
more intensely we listen, the more all discords melt
away into higher harmonies, till at last we hear but
one majestic trichord, or a mighty unison, as at the
end of a sacred symphony. Such visions will float
through the study of the grammarian, and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
midst of toilsome researches his heart will suddenly
beat, as he feels the conviction growing upon him
that men are brethren in the simplest sense of the
word&mdash;the children of the same father&mdash;whatever
their country, their language, and their faith.</p>

<h2>LIFE</h2>


<p>All really great and honest men may be said to
live three lives: there is one life which is seen
and accepted by the world at large, a man's outward
life; there is a second life which is seen by a man's
most intimate friends, his household life; and there
is a third life, seen only by the man himself, and by
Him who searcheth the heart, which may be called
the inner or heavenly&mdash;a life led in communion with
God, a life of aspiration rather than of fulfilment.</p>

<p>Where Plato could only see imperfections, the
failures of the founders of human speech,
we see, as everywhere else in human life, a natural
progress from the imperfect towards the perfect,
unceasing attempts at realising the ideal, and the
frequent triumphs of the human mind over the
inevitable difficulties of this earthly condition&mdash;difficulties
not of man's own making, but, as I firmly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
believe, prepared for him, and not without a purpose,
as toils and tasks, by a higher Power, and by the
highest wisdom.</p>

<p class="sig">

</p>


<p>Our life is not completely in our hands&mdash;we must
submit to many things which we may smile
at in our inmost heart, but which nevertheless are
essential, not only to our happiness, but to our
fulfilling the duties which we are called to fulfil. We
ought to look upon the circumstances in which we
are born and brought up as ordained by a Higher
Power, and we must learn to walk the path which
is pointed out to us!</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Life.</em>
</p>


<p>It is difficult to be always true to ourselves, to be
always what we wish to be, what we feel we
ought to be. As long as we feel that, as long as we
do not surrender the ideal of our life, all is right.
Our aspirations represent the true nature of our soul
much more than our everyday life. I feel as much
as you, how far I have been left behind in the race
which I meant to run, but I honestly try to rouse
myself, and to live up to what I feel I ought to be.
Let us keep up our constant fight against all that is
small and common and selfish, let us never lose our
faith in the ideal life, in what we ought to be, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
in what with constant prayer to God we shall be,
and let us never forget how unworthy we are of all
the blessings God has showered down upon us.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Life.</em>
</p>


<p>I feel quite thankful for any little misfortune; it
is like paying something of the large debt of
happiness we owe, though it is but a very trifling
interest, and the capital we must owe for ever.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>MS.</em>
</p>


<p>I thought a long time about my happiness, and
my unworthiness, and God's unbounded mercy.
And then I heard the words within me: 'Be not
afraid.' Yes, there must be no fear. Where there
is fear there is no perfect love. Our happiness here
is but a foretaste of our blessed life hereafter. We
must never forget that. We shall be called away,
but we shall meet again.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>MS.</em>
</p>


<p>I begin to be quite thankful for my disappointment&mdash;we
all want winding up, and nothing does it
so well as a great disappointment, if we only see
clearly Who sent it and then forget everything else.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>MS.</em>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>


<p>One sometimes forgets that all this is only the
preparation for what is to come hereafter.
Yet we should never forget this, otherwise this life
loses its true meaning and purpose. If we only know
what we live for here, we can easily find out what
is worth having in this life, and what is not; we can
easily go on without many things which others, whose
eyes are fixed on this world only, consider essential
to their happiness.</p>

<p class="sig">

</p>


<p>The spirit of love, and the spirit of truth, are the
two life-springs of our whole being&mdash;or, what
is the same, of our whole religion. If we lose that
bond, which holds us and binds us to a higher world,
our life becomes purposeless, joyless; if it holds us
and supports, life becomes perfect, all little cares
vanish, and we feel we are working out a great
purpose as well as we can, a purpose not our own,
not selfish, not self-seeking, but, in the truest sense
of the word, God-serving and God-seeking....
Gentleness is a kind of mixture of love and truthfulness,
and it should be the highest object of our
life to attain more and more to that true gentleness
which throws such a charm over all our life. There
is a gentleness of voice, of look, of movement, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
speech, all of which are but the expressions of true
gentleness of heart.</p>

<p class="sig">

<p>It is impossible to take too high a view of life;
the very highest we take is still too low. One
feels that more and more as our life draws to its
close, and many things that seemed important once
are seen to be of no consequence, while only a few
things remain which will tell for ever.</p>

<p class="sig">

<p>I don't believe in what is called worldly wisdom.
I do not think the world was made for it&mdash;with
real faith in a higher life I believe one can pass
through this life without let or hindrance. What I
dread are compromises. There are false notes in
them always, and a false note goes on for ever.</p>

<p class="sig">

<p>How thankful we ought to be every minute of
our existence to Him who gives us all richly
to enjoy. How little one has deserved this happy
life, much less than many poor sufferers to whom
life is a burden and a hard and bitter trial. But then,
how much greater the claims on us; how much
more sacred the duty never to trifle, never to waste
time and power, never to compromise, but to live in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
all things, small and great, to the praise and glory of
God, to have God always present with us, and to be
ready to follow His voice, and His voice only. Has
our prosperity taught us to meet adversity when it
comes? I often tremble, but then I commit all to
God, and I say, 'Have mercy upon me, miserable
sinner.'</p>

<p class="sig">

<p>There is something very awful in this life, and
it is not right to try to forget it. It is well
to be reminded by the trials of others of what may
befall us, and what is kept from us only by the love
of our Father in heaven, not by any merit of our
own.</p>

<p>How different life is to what one thought it when
young, how all around us falls together, till
we ourselves fall together. How meaningless and
vain everything seems on earth, and how closely the
reality of the life beyond approaches us. Many days
were beautiful here, but the greater the happiness the
more bitter the thought that it all passes away, that
nothing remains of earthly happiness, but a grateful
heart and faith in God who knows best what is best
for us.</p>

<p>Oh! if we could even in this life forget all that is
unessential, all that makes it so hard for us to
recognise true greatness and goodness in the character
of those with whom this life brings us in contact for a
little while! How much we lose by making little things
so important, and how rarely do we think highly
enough of what is essential and lasting!</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>MS.</em>
</p>


<p>You must accustom yourself more and more to
the thought that here is not our abiding city,
that all that we call ours here is only lent, not given us,
and that if the sorrow for those we have lost remains
the same, we must yet acknowledge with gratitude to
God the great blessing of having enjoyed so many
years with those whom He gave us, as parents, or
children, or friends. One forgets so easily the happy
years one has had with those who were the nearest
to us. Even these years of happiness, however short
they may have been, were only given us, we had not
deserved them. I know well there is no comfort for
this pain of parting: the wound always remains, but
one learns to bear the pain, and learns to thank God
for what He gave, for the beautiful memories of the
past, and the yet more beautiful hope for the future.
If a man has lent us anything for several years, and
at last takes it back, he expects gratitude, not anger;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
and if God has more patience with our weakness than
men have, yet murmurs and complaints for the life
which He measured out for us as is best for us, are
not what He expected from us. A spirit of resignation
to God's will is our only comfort, the only relief under
the trials God lays upon us, and with such a spirit the
heaviest as well as the lightest trials of life are not
only bearable, but useful, and gratitude to God and
joy in life and death remain untroubled.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Life.</em>
</p>


<p>By a grave one learns what life really is&mdash;that it is
not here but elsewhere&mdash;that this is the exile
and there is our home. As we grow older the train
of life goes faster and faster, those with whom we
travelled together step out from station to station, and
our own station too will soon be reached.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>MS.</em>
</p>


<p>It seems to me so ungrateful to allow one moment
to pass that is not full of joy and happiness, and
devotion to Him who gives us all this richly to enjoy.
The clouds will come, they must come, but they ought
never to be of our own making.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Life.</em>
</p>


<p>The shadows fall thicker and thicker, but even in
the shade it is well, often better than in full
sunshine. And when the evening comes, one is tired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
and ready to sleep! And so all is ordered for us, if
we only accommodate ourselves to it quietly.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Life.</em>
</p>


<p>As long as God wills it we must learn to bear this
life, but when He calls us we willingly close
our eyes, for we know it is better for us there than
here. When so many whom we loved are gone
before us, we follow gladly; and the older we become
here, the more one feels that death is a relief. And
yet we can thankfully enjoy what is still left us on
earth, even if our hearts no longer cling to it as
formerly.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Life.</em>
</p>


<p>Our life here is not our own work, and we know
that it is best for us all just as it is. We ought
to bear it, and we must bear it; and the more
patiently, yes, the more joyfully, we accommodate
ourselves to it, the better for us. We must take life
as it is, as the way appointed for us, and that must
lead to a certain goal. Some go sooner, some later,
but we all go the same way, and all find the same
place of rest. Impatience, gloom, murmurs and tears
do not help us, do not alter anything, and make the
road longer, not shorter. Quiet, resignation, thankfulness
and faith help us forwards, and alone make it
possible to perform the duties which we all, each in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
his own sphere, have to fulfil.... The darker the
night, the clearer the stars in heaven.</p>

<p class="sig">

</p>


<p>How different life might be, if in our daily intercourse
and conversation we thought of our
friends as lying before us on the last bed of flowers&mdash;how
differently we should then judge, and how
differently we should act. All that is of the earth is
then forgotten, all the little failings inherent in human
nature vanish from our minds, and we only see what
was good, unselfish, and loving in that soul, and we
think with regret of how much more we might have
done to requite that love. It is curious how forgetful
we are of death, how little we think that we are dying
daily, and that what we call life is really death, and
death the beginning of a higher life. Such a thought
should not make our life less bright, but rather more&mdash;it
should make us feel how unimportant many things
are which we consider all-important: how much we
could bear which we think unbearable, if only we
thought that to-morrow we ourselves or our friends
may be taken away, at least for a time. You should
think of death, should feel that what you call your
own is only lent to you, and that all that remains
as a real comfort is the good work done in this short
journey, the true unselfish love shown to those whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
God has given us, has placed near to us, not without
a high purpose.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Life.</em>
</p>


<p>What a marvel life seems to be the older we
grow! So far from becoming more intelligible,
it becomes a greater wonder every day.
One stands amazed, and everything seems so small&mdash;the
little one can do so very small. One ought not
to brood too much, when there is no chance of light,
and yet how natural it is that one should brood over
life and death, rather than on the little things of life.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Life.</em>
</p>


<p>If we only hold fast the belief that nothing happens
but by the will of God, we learn to be still and
can bear everything. The older one grows, the more
one feels sure that life here is but a long imprisonment,
and one longs for freedom and higher efforts....
How small and insignificant is all in this life when we
raise our eyes above. Gazing up to the Lord of the
Universe, all strife is made easy. We speak different
tongues when we think of the Highest, but we all
mean the same thing.</p>

<p class="sig">

<p>It is sad to think of all that was and is no more,
and yet there is something much more real in
memory than one used to think. All is there but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
what our weak human senses require, and nothing is lost,
nothing can be lost except what we know would vanish
one day, but what was the husk only, not the kernel.
I have learnt to live with those who went before us,
and they seem more entirely our own than when they
were with us in the body. And as long as we have
duties to fulfil, so long as there are others who lean
on us and want us, life can be lived a few years
longer, it can only be a few years.</p>

<p class="sig">

</p>


<p>Life is earnest! is a very old lesson, and we are
never too old to learn it. 'Life is an art' is
Goethe's doctrine, and there is some truth in it also,
as long as art does not imply artful or artificial.
Huxley used to say the highest end of life is action,
not knowledge. There I quite differ. First knowledge,
then action, and what a lottery action is! The
best intentions often fail, and what is done to-day is
undone to-morrow. However, we must toil on and
do what every day brings us, and do it as well as we
can, and better, if possible, than anybody else.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Life.</em>
</p>


<p>What can we call ours if God did not vouchsafe
it to us from day to day? Yet it is so
difficult to give oneself up entirely to Him, to trust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
everything to His Love and Wisdom. I thought I
could say, 'Thy Will be done,' but I found I could not:
my own will struggled against His Will. I prayed as
we ought not to pray, and yet He heard me. It is so
difficult not to grow very fond of this life and all its
happiness, but the more we love it, the more we
suffer, for we know we must lose it and it must all
pass away.</p>

<p>Our idea of life grows larger, and birth and death
seem like morning and evening. One feels
that as it has been so it will be again, and all one can
do is to try to make the best of every day, as it comes
and goes.</p>

<p class="sig">

</p>


<p>The things that annoy us in life are after all very
trifling things, if we always bear in mind for
what purpose we are here. And even in the heavier
trials, one knows, or one should know, that all is sent
by a higher power, and in the end must be for our
best interests. It is true we cannot understand it,
but we can understand that God rules in the world in
the smallest and in the largest events, and he who
keeps that ever in mind has the peace of God, and
enjoys his life as long as it lasts.</p>

<p>Life may grow more strange and awful every
day, but the more strange and awful it grows,
the more it reveals to us its truest meaning and
reality, and the deepest depth of its divinity. 'And

<p>Enjoy the precious years God has added to your
life, with constant gratitude, with quiet and
purity of soul, looking more to the heavenly than to
the earthly: that gives true joyfulness of soul, if we

quite lose ourselves in the small, or even the large
cares of life.</p>

<p>If we live on this earth only, if our thoughts are
hemmed in by the narrow horizon of this life,
then we lose indeed those whom death takes from us.
But it is death itself which teaches us that there is a
Beyond, we are lifted up and see a new world, far
beyond what we had seen before. In that wide
world we lead a new and larger life, a life which
includes those we no longer see on earth, but whom
we cannot surrender. The old Indian philosophers
say that no one can find the truth whose heart is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
attached to his wife and children. No doubt perfect
freedom from all affections would make life and death
very easy. But may not the very love which we feel
for those who belong to us, even when they are taken
from us, bring light to our eyes, and make us see the
truth that, by that very love, we belong to another
world, and that from that world, however little we can
here know about it, love will not be excluded. We
believe what we desire&mdash;true&mdash;but why do we desire?
Let us be ourselves, let us be what we are meant to
be on earth, and trust to Him who made us what we
are.</p>

<p>Yes, every day adds a new thin layer of new
thoughts, and these layers form the texture of
our character. The materials come floating towards
us, but the way in which they settle down depends
much on the ebb and flow within us. We can do
much to keep off foreign elements, and to attach and
retain those which serve best in building up a strong
rock. But from time to time a great sorrow breaks
through all the strata of our soul&mdash;all is upheaved,
shattered, distorted. In nature all that is grand dates
from such convulsions&mdash;why should we wish for a
new smooth surface, or let our sorrows be covered
by the flat sediment of everyday life?</p>

<p>If we feel that this life can only be a link in a
chain without beginning and without end, in a
circle which has its beginning and its end everywhere
and nowhere, we learn to bear it, and to enjoy it too,
in a new sense. What we achieve here assumes a
new meaning&mdash;it will not altogether perish, whether
for good or for evil. What is done in time is done
for ever&mdash;what is done by one affects us all. Thus
our love too is not lost&mdash;what is loved in time is
loved for ever. The form changes, but that which
changes, which undergoes change, remains itself
unchanged. We seem to love the fleeting forms
of life, and yet how can we truly love what is so
faithless? No, we truly love what is, and was, and
will be, hidden under the fleeting forms of life, but in
itself more than those fleeting forms however fair.
We love the fair appearance too, how could it be
otherwise? but we should love it only as belonging
to what we love&mdash;not as being what we love. So
it is, or rather so it ought to be. Yet while we
are what we are, we love the flower, not the sightless
grain of seed, and when that flower fades and passes
away, we mourn for it, and our only comfort is that
we too fade and pass away. Then we follow there,
wherever they go. Some flowers fade sooner, some
later, but none is quite forgotten.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to say at what moment in our
young lives real responsibility begins. The law
fixes a time, our own heart cannot do that. Yet in
spite of this unknown quantity at the beginning, we
begin afterwards to reckon with ourselves. Why
should we protest against a similar unknown quantity
before the beginning of our life on earth? Wherever
and whenever it was, we feel that we have made ourselves
what we are; is not that a useful article of faith?
Does it not help us to decide on undoing what we
have done wrong and in doing all the good we can,
even if it does not bear fruit, within or without, in
this life? A break of consciousness does not seem
incompatible with a sense of responsibility, if we
know by reasoning, though not by recollection, that
what we see done in ourselves must have been done
by ourselves. And even if we waive the question
of responsibility for the first two or three years of
our life on earth, surely we existed during those
years though we do not recollect it,&mdash;then why
not before our life on earth?</p>

<p>We must learn to live two lives&mdash;this short life
here on earth with its joys and sorrows, and
that true life beyond, of which this is only a fragment
or an interruption. When we enter into that true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
life, we shall find what we cannot find here, we
shall find what we have lost here. If only so many
things did not seem so irregular, so unnatural.
The death of young children before their parents.
We love them better because we know we can lose
them&mdash;that is true&mdash;but yet it is a hard lesson
to learn.</p>

<p>One month will go after another, till at last this
journey is over, and we look back on it grateful
for the many pleasures it has given us, grateful for the
company of so many kind friends whom we met,
grateful also for the struggles which we had to go
through and which will appear so small, and so little
worth our tears and anguish, when all is over and
the last station and resting-place reached in safety.</p>

<h2>LOVE</h2>


<p>I cannot help thinking that the souls towards
whom we feel drawn in this life are the very
souls whom we knew and loved in a former life, and
that the souls who repel us here, we do not know
why, are the souls that earned our disapproval, the
souls from whom we kept aloof, in a former life.
But let us remember that if our love is the love
of what is merely phenomenal, the love of the body,
the kindness of the heart, the vigour and wisdom of
the intellect, our love is the love of changing and
perishable things.... But if our love, under all its
earthly aspects, was the love of the true soul, of what
is immortal and divine in every man and woman, that
love cannot die, but will find once more what seems
beautiful, true, and lovable in worlds to come, as in
worlds that have passed.... What we truly love in
everything is the eternal <em>âtman</em>, the immortal self,
and as we should add, the immortal God, for the
immortal self and the immortal God must be one.</p>

<p>We must not forget that if earthly love has in the
vulgar mind been often degraded into mere
animal passion, it still remains in its purest sense the
highest mystery of our existence, the most perfect
blessing and delight on earth, and at the same time
the truest pledge of our more than human nature.
To be able to feel the same unselfish devotion to the
Deity which the human heart is capable of, if filled
with love for another human soul, is something that
may well be called the best religion.</p>

<p>What the present generation ought to learn, the
young as well as the old, is spirit and perseverance
to discover the beautiful, pleasure and joy in
making it known, and resigning ourselves with grateful
hearts to its enjoyment; in a word&mdash;love, in the
old, true, eternal meaning of the word. Only sweep
away the dust of self-conceit, the cobwebs of selfishness,
the mud of envy, and the old type of humanity
will soon reappear, as it was when it could still
'embrace millions.' The love of mankind, the true
fountain of all humanity, is still there; it can never be
quite choked up. He who can descend into this
fountain of youth, who can again recover himself,
who can again be that which he was by nature, loves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
the beautiful wherever he finds it; he understands enjoyment
and enthusiasm, in the few quiet hours which
he can win for himself in the noisy, deafening hurry
of the times in which we live.</p>

<p>Would not the carrying out of one single commandment
of Christ, 'Love one another,'
change the whole aspect of the world, and sweep
away prisons and workhouses, and envying and strife,
and all the strongholds of the devil? Two thousand
years have nearly passed, and people have not yet
understood that one single command of Christ, 'Love
one another'! We are as perfect heathens in that
one respect as it is possible to be. No, this world
might be heaven on earth, if we would but carry out
God's work and God's commandments, and so it will
be hereafter.</p>

<p>If we do a thing because we think it is our duty, we
generally fail; that is the old law which makes
slaves of us. The real spring of our life, and of our
work in life, must be love&mdash;true, deep love&mdash;not love
of this or that person, or for this or that reason, but
deep human love, devotion of soul to soul, love of God
realised where alone it can be, in love of those whom
He loves. Everything else is weak, passes away;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
that love alone supports us, makes life tolerable, binds
the present together with the past and future, and is,
we may trust, imperishable.</p>

<p>Love which seems so unselfish may become very
selfish if we are not on our guard. Do not
shut your eyes to what is dark in others, but do not
dwell on it except so far as it helps to bring out more
strongly what is bright in them, lovely, and unselfish.
The true happiness of true love is self-forgetfulness
and trust.</p>

<p>There is nothing in life like a mother's love,
though children often do not find it out till it is
too late. If you want to be really happy in life, love
your mother with all your heart; it is a blessing to
feel that you belong to her, and that through her you
are connected by an unbroken chain with the highest
source of our being.</p>

<p>Is there such a thing as a Lost Love? I do not
believe it. Nothing that is true and great is
ever lost on earth, though its fulfilment may be deferred
beyond this short life.... Love is eternal,
and all the more so if it does not meet with its fulfilment
on earth. If once we know that our lives are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
in the hands of God, and that nothing can happen to
us without His Will, we are thankful for the trials
which He sends us. Is there any one who loves us
more than God? any one who knows better what is
for our real good than God? This little artificial and
complicated society of ours may sometimes seem to
be outside His control, but if we think so it is our own
fault, and we have to suffer for it. We blame our
friends, we mistrust ourselves, and all this because our
wild hearts will not be quiet in that narrow cage in
which they must be kept to prevent mischief.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Life.</em>
</p>


<p>Does love pass away (with death)? I cannot
believe it. God made us as we are, many instead
of one. Christ died for all of us individually,
and such as we are&mdash;beings incomplete in themselves,
and perfect only through love to God on one side, and
through love to man on the other. We want both
kinds of love for our very existence, and therefore in
a higher and better existence too the love of kindred
souls may well exist together with our love of God.
We need not love those we love best on earth less in
heaven, though we may love all better than we do on
earth. After all, love seems only the taking away
those unnatural barriers which divide us from our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
fellow creatures&mdash;it is only the restoration of that
union which binds us altogether in God, and which
has broken on earth we know not how. In Christ
alone that union was preserved, for He loved us <em>all</em>
with a love warmer than the love of a husband for his
wife, or a mother for her child. He gave His life for
us, and if we ask ourselves there is hardly a husband
or a mother who would really suffer death for his
wife or her child. Thus we see that even what seems
to us the most perfect love is very far as yet from the
perfection of love which drives out the whole self and
all that is selfish, and we must try to love more, not to
love less, and trust that what is imperfect here is not
meant to be destroyed, but to be made perfect hereafter.
With God nothing is imperfect; without Him
everything is imperfect. We must live and love in
God, and then we need not fear: though our life seem
chequered and fleeting, we know that there is a home
for us in God, and rest for all our troubles in Christ.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Life.</em>
</p>


<p>Let us hold together while life lasts. Hand in
hand we may achieve more than each alone by
himself. We are much less afraid when we are two
together. The chief condition of all spiritual friendship
is perfect frankness. There is no better proof<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
of true friendship than sincere reproof, where such
reproof is necessary. We are occupied in one great
work, and in this consciousness all that is small must
necessarily disappear.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Life.</em>
</p>


<p>Why do we love so deeply? Is not that also
God's will? And if so, why should that love
ever cease? What should we be without it? I cannot
believe that we are to surrender that love, that we
are to lose those who were given us to love. Love
may be purified, may become more and more unselfish,
may be very different from what it was on
earth, but sympathy, suffering together and rejoicing
together, lies very deep at the root of all being&mdash;were
it ever to cease, our very being might cease too. We
cannot help loving, loving more and more, better and
better. Thus life becomes brighter and brighter
again, and we feel that we have not lost those who
are taken from us for a little while. We love them
all the more, all the better.</p>

<p>How selfish we are even in our love. Here we
live for a short season, and we know we must
part sooner or later. We wish to go first, and to
leave those whom we love behind us, and we sorrow
because they went first and left us behind. As soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>

there was a time when it seemed endless.</p>

<h2>MANKIND</h2>


<p>The earth was unintelligible to the ancients because
looked upon as a solitary being, without a peer
in the whole universe; but it assumed a new and true
significance as soon as it rose before the eyes of man
as one of many planets, all governed by the same
laws, and all revolving around the same centre. It is
the same with the human soul, and its nature stands
before our mind in quite a different light since man
has been taught to know and feel himself as a member
of a great family&mdash;as one of the myriads of wandering
stars all governed by the same laws, and all revolving
around the same centre, and all deriving their light
from the same source. 'Universal History' has laid
open new avenues of thought, and it has enriched our
language with a word which never passed the lips of
Socrates, or Plato, or Aristotle&mdash;<em>Mankind</em>. Where
the Greek saw barbarians, we see brethren; where the
Greek saw nations, we see mankind, toiling and
suffering, separated by oceans, divided by language,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
and severed by national enmity,&mdash;yet evermore tending,
under a divine control, towards the fulfilment of
that inscrutable purpose for which the world was
created, and man placed in it, bearing the image of
God. History therefore, with its dusty and mouldering
pages, is to us as sacred a volume as the book of
nature. In both we read, or we try to read, the
reflex of the laws and thoughts of a Divine Wisdom.
We believe that there is nothing irrational in either
history or nature, and that the human mind is called
upon to read and to revere in both the manifestations
of a Divine Power.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Chips.</em>
</p>


<p>There are two antagonistic schools&mdash;the one
believing in a descending, the other in an
ascending development of the human race; the one
asserting that the history of the human mind begins
of necessity with a state of purity and simplicity which
gradually gives way to corruption, perversity, and
savagery; the other maintaining that the first human
beings could not have been more than one step above
the animals, and that their whole history is one of
progress towards higher perfection. With regard to
the beginnings of religion, the one school holds to a
primitive suspicion of something that is beyond&mdash;call
it supernatural, transcendental, infinite, or divine. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
considers a silent walking across this bridge of life,
with eyes fixed on high, as a more perfect realisation
of primitive religion than singing of Vedic hymns,
offering of Jewish sacrifices, or the most elaborate
creeds and articles. The other begins with the purely
animal and passive nature of man, and tries to show
how the repeated impressions of the world in which
he lived, drove him to fetichism and totemism, whatever
these words may mean, to ancestor worship, to a
worship of nature, of trees and serpents, of mountains
and rivers, of clouds and meteors, of sun and moon
and stars, and the vault of heaven, and at last to a
belief in One who dwells in heaven above.</p>

<h2>MIND OR THOUGHT</h2>


<p>Wherever we can see clearly, we see that
what we call mind and thought consist in
this, that man has the power not only to receive
presentations like an animal, but to discover something
general in them. This element he can eliminate and
fix by vocal signs; and he can further classify single
presentations under the same general concepts, and
mark them by the same vocal signs.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Silesian Horseherd.</em>
</p>


<p>Language and thought go hand in hand; where
there is as yet no word, there is not yet an
idea. The thinking capacity of the mind has its
source in language, lives in language, and develops
continually in language.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Silesian Horseherd.</em>
</p>


<p>All our thoughts, even the apparently most
abstract, have their natural beginnings in what
passes daily before our senses. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nihil in fide nisi quod</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante fuerit in sensu.</i> Man may for a time be unheedful
of these voices of nature; but they come again and
again, day after day, night after night, till at last they
are heeded. And if once heeded, those voices disclose
their purport more and more clearly, and what seemed
at first a mere sunrise becomes in the end a visible
revelation of the infinite, while the setting of the sun
is transfigured into the first vision of immortality.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Hibbert Lectures.</em>
</p>


<p>As the evolution of nature can be studied with any
hope of success in those products only which
nature has left us, the evolution of mind also can be
effectually studied in those products only which mind
itself has left us. These mental products in their
earliest form are always embodied in language, and it
is in language, therefore, that we must study the
problem of the origin, and of the successive stages in
the growth of mind.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Science of Thought.</em>
</p>


<p>If language and reason are identical, or two names,
or two aspects only of the same thing, and if we
cannot doubt that language had an historical beginning,
and represents the work of man carried on through many
thousands of years, we cannot avoid the conclusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
that before those thousands of years there was a time
when the first stone of the great temple of language
was laid, and before that time man was without language,
and therefore without reason.</p>

<h2>MIRACLES</h2>


<p>If once the human mind has arrived at the conviction
that <em>everything</em> must be accounted for, or, as it is
sometimes expressed, that there is uniformity, that
there is care and order in everything, and that an
unbroken chain of cause and effect holds the whole
universe together, then the idea of the miraculous
arises, and we, weak human creatures, call what is
not intelligible to us, what is not in accordance with
law, what seems to break through the chain of cause
and effect, a miracle. Every miracle, therefore, is of
our own making, and of our own unmaking.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, III.</em>
</p>


<p>It is due to the psychological necessities of human
nature, under the inspiring influence of religious
enthusiasm, that so many of the true signs and
wonders performed by the founders of religion have
so often been exaggerated, and, in spite of the
strongest protests of these founders themselves, degraded
into mere jugglery. It is true that all this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
does not form an essential element of religion, as we
now understand religion. Miracles are no longer used
as arguments in support of the truth of religious
doctrines. Miracles have often been called helps to
faith, but they have so often proved stumbling-blocks
to faith, and no one in our days would venture to say
that the truth as taught by any religion must stand or
fall by certain prodigious events which may or may
not have happened, which may or may not have been
rightly apprehended by the followers of Buddha,
Christ, or Mohammed.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, II.</em>
</p>


<p>Our Lord's ascension will have to be understood
as a sublime idea, materialised in the language
of children. Is not a real fact that happened, in a
world in which nothing can happen against the will
of God, better than any miracle? Why should we
try to know more than we can know, if only we
firmly believe that Christ's immortal spirit ascended
to the Father? That alone is true immortality, divine
immortality; not the resuscitation of the frail mortal
body, but the immortality of the immortal divine soul.
It was this rising of the Spirit, and not of the body,
without which, as St. Paul said, our faith would be
vain. It is the Spirit that quickeneth, the flesh
profiteth nothing.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, III.</em>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be to many of the honest disciples of Christ
a real day of Damascus, when the very name of
miracle shall be struck out of the dictionary of Christian
theology. The facts remain exactly as they are,
but the Spirit of truth will give them a higher meaning.
What is wanted for this is not less, but more, faith, for
it requires more faith to believe in Christ without, than
with, the help of miracles. Nothing has produced so
much distress of mind, so much intellectual dishonesty,
so much scepticism, so much unbelief, as the miraculous
element forced into Christianity from the earliest
days. Nothing has so much impeded missionary work
as the attempt to persuade people first not to believe
in their own miracles, and then to make a belief in
other miracles a condition of their becoming Christians.
It is easy to say 'You are not a Christian if you do
not believe in Christian miracles.' I hope the time
will come when we shall be told, 'You are not a
Christian if you cannot believe in Christ without the
help of miracles.'</p>

<h2>MUSIC</h2>


<p>Music is the language of the soul, but it defies
interpretation. It means something, but that
something belongs not to this world of sense and
logic, but to another world, quite real, though beyond
all definition.... Is there not in Music, and in Music
alone of all the arts, something that is not entirely of
this earth?... Whence comes melody? Surely not
from anything that we hear with our outward ears
and are able to imitate, to improve, or to sublimise....
Here if anywhere we see the golden stairs on which
angels descend from heaven and whisper sweet sounds
into the ears of those who have ears to hear. Words
cannot be so inspired, for words, we know, are of the
earth, earthy. Melodies are not of the earth, and it
is truly said,</p>

<h2>NATURE</h2>


<p>There is nothing so beautiful as being alone with
nature; one sees how God's will is fulfilled in
each bud and leaf that blooms and withers, and one
learns to recognise how deeply rooted in one is this
thirst for nature. In living with men one is only too
easily torn from this real home; then one's own plans
and wishes and fears spring up; then we fancy we
can perfect something for ourselves alone, and think
that every thing must serve for our own ends and
enjoyments, until the influence of nature in life, or the
hand of God, arouses us, and warns us that we live
and flourish not for enjoyment, nor for undisturbed
quiet, but to bear fruit in another life.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Life.</em>
</p>


<p>When one stands amid the grandeur of nature, with
one's own little murmurings and sufferings,
and looks deep into this dumb soul, much becomes
clear to one, and one is astounded at the false ideas
one has formed of this life. It is but a short journey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
and on a journey one can do without many things
which generally seem necessary to us. Yes, we can
do without even what is dearest to our hearts, in this
world, if we know that, after the journey we shall
have to endure, we shall find again those who have
arrived at the goal quicker and more easily than we
have done. Now if life were looked upon as a journey
for refreshment or amusement, which it ought not to
be, we might feel sad if we have to make our way
alone; but if we treat it as a serious business-journey,
then we know we have hard and unpleasant work
before us, and enjoy all the more the beautiful resting-places
which God's love has provided for each of us
in life.</p>

<p>In the early days of the world, the world was too
full of wonders to require any other miracles.
The whole world was a miracle and a revelation,
there was no need for any special disclosure. At
that time the heavens, the waters, the sun and moon,
the stars of heaven, the showers and dew, the winds
of God, fire and heat, winter and summer, ice and
snow, nights and days, lightnings and clouds, the
earth, the mountains and hills, the green things upon
the earth, the wells, and seas and floods&mdash;all blessed
the Lord, praised Him and magnified Him for ever.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
Can we imagine a more powerful revelation? Is it
for us to say that for the children of men to join in
praising and magnifying Him who revealed Himself
in His own way in all the magnificence, the wisdom
and order of nature, is mere paganism, polytheism,
pantheism, and abominable idolatry? I have heard
many blasphemies, I have heard none greater than
this.</p>

<p>There may be much depth of wisdom in all that
darkness and vagueness, but I cannot help
thinking that there is nothing that cannot be made
clear, and bright, and simple, and that obscurity
arises in all cases from slovenly thinking and lazy
writing.</p>

<h2>OLD AGE</h2>


<p>Sharing the happiness of other people, entering
into their feelings, living life over once more with
them and in them, that is all that remains to old
people. I suppose it was meant to be so, the principal
object of life being the overcoming of self, in
every sense of the word.</p>

<p class="sig">

<p>This is a lesson one has to learn as one grows
older, to learn to be alone, and yet to feel one
in spirit with all whom one loves, whether present or
absent.</p>

<p>You cannot escape from old age, whether it
comes slowly or suddenly, but it comes unawares,
and you suddenly feel that you cannot walk
or jump as you used to do, and even the muscles of
the mind don't hold out as they used. Well, so it
was meant to be, and it will be pleasant to begin
again with new muscles, and to take up new work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
After seeing a good deal of life, I still think the greatest
satisfaction is work: I do not mean drudgery, but
one's own findings out.</p>

<p>As one is getting old, and looks forward with fear
rather than with hope to what is still in store
for us, one learns to appreciate more and more the
never-failing pleasure of recalling all the bright and
happy days that are gone. Gone they are, but they
are not lost. Ever present to our calling and recalling,
they assume at last a vividness, such as they
hardly had when present, and when we poor souls
were trembling for every day and hour and minute
that was going and ever going, and would not and
could not abide.</p>

<h2>RELIGION AND RELIGIONS</h2>


<p>God is not far from each one of those who seek
God, if haply they may feel after Him. Let
theologians pile up volume upon volume of what
they call theology, religion is a very simple matter,
and that which is so simple and yet so all-important
to us, the living kernel of religion, can be found, I
believe, in almost every creed, however much the
husk may vary. And think what that means! It
means that above and beneath and behind all religions
there is one eternal, one universal religion, a religion
to which every man belongs, or may belong.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Last Essays.</em>
</p>


<p>True religion, that is practical, active, living
religion, has little or nothing to do with logical
or metaphysical quibbles. Practical religion is life, is
a new life, a life in the sight of God, and it springs
from what may truly be called a new birth.</p>

<p>Our senses can never perceive a real boundary,
be it on the largest or the smallest scale: they
present to us everywhere the infinite as their background,
and everything that has to do with religion
has sprung out of this infinite background as its
ultimate and deepest foundation.</p>

<p>I cannot bring myself to take much interest in
all the controversies that are going on (1865)
in the Church of England.... No doubt the points
at issue are great, and appeal to our hearts and minds,
but the spirit in which they are treated seems to me
so very small. How few men on either side give
you the impression that they write face to face with
God, and not face to face with men and the small
powers that be. Surely this was not so in the early
centuries, nor again at the time of the Reformation?</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Life.</em>

<p>We live in two worlds; behind the seen is the
unseen, around the finite the infinite, above
the comprehensible the incomprehensible. There
have been men who have lived in this world only,
who seem never to have felt the real presence of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
unseen: and yet they achieved some greatness as
rulers of men, as poets, artists, philosophers, and
discoverers. But the greatest among the great have
done their greatest works in moments of self-forgetful
ecstasy, in union and communion with a higher
world: and when it was done, such was their silent
rapture that they started back, and could not believe
it was their own, their very own, and they ascribed
the glory of it to God, by whatever name they called
Him in their various utterances. And while the
greatest among the great thus confessed that they
were not of this world only, and that their best work
was but in part their own, those whom we reverence
as the founders of religions, and who were at once
philosophers, poets, and rulers of men, called nothing
their own, but professed to teach only either what
their fathers had taught them, or what a far-off voice
had whispered in their ear.... The ancient religions
were not founded like temples or palaces, they sprang
up like sacred groves from the soil of humanity,
quickened by the rays of celestial light. In India,
Greece, Italy, and Germany, not even the names of
the earliest prophets are preserved. And, if in other
countries the forms and features of the authors of
their religious faith and worship are still dimly visible
amidst the clouds of legend and poetry, all of them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Moses as well as Zoroaster, Confucius, Buddha and
Mohammed, seem to proclaim with one voice that
their faith was no new faith, but the faith of their
fathers, that their wisdom was not their own wisdom,
but, like every good and perfect gift, given them
from above. What should we learn from these
prophets who from distant countries and bygone
ages all bear the same witness to the same truth?
We should learn that though religions may be
founded and fashioned into strange shapes by the
hand of man, religion is one and eternal. From the
first dawn that ever brightened a human hearth or
warmed a human heart, one generation has told
another that there is a world beyond the dawn; and
the keynotes of all religion&mdash;the feeling of the
infinite, the bowing down before the incomprehensible,
the yearning after the unseen&mdash;having once
been set to vibrate, have never been altogether
drowned in the strange and wild music of religious
sects and sciences. The greatest prophets of the
world have been those who at sundry times and in
divers manners have proclaimed again and again in
the simplest words the simple creed of the fathers,
faith in the unseen, reverence for the incomprehensible,
awe of the infinite, or, simpler still, love
of God, and oneness with the All-Father.</p>

<p>I have endeavoured to make clear two things,
which constitute the foundation of all religion;
first, that the world is rational, that it is the result
of thought, and that in this sense only is it the
creation of a being which possesses reason, or is
reason itself (the <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">Logos</i>); and secondly, that mind or
thought cannot be the outcome of matter, but on
the contrary is the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prius</i> of all things.</p>

<p>Religion is not philosophy; but there never has
been a religion, and there never can be, which
is not based on philosophy, and does not presuppose
the philosophical notions of the people. The highest
aim towards which all philosophy strives, is and will
always remain the idea of God, and it was this idea
which Christianity grasped in the Platonic sense, and
presented to us most clearly in its highest form, in
the Fourth Gospel.</p>

<p class="sig">

<p>There has been no entirely new religion since
the beginning of the world. The elements
and roots of religion were there, as far back as we can
trace the history of man; and the history of religion
shows us throughout a succession of new combinations
of the same radical elements. An intuition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
God, a sense of human weakness and dependence,
a belief in a Divine government of the world, a
distinction between good and evil, and a hope of a
better life, these are some of the radical elements of
all religions. Though sometimes hidden, they rise
again and again to the surface. Though frequently
distorted, they tend again and again to their perfect
form. Unless they had formed part of the original
dowry of the human soul, religion would have
remained an impossibility, and the tongues of angels
would have been to human ears but as sounding
brass, or as tinkling cymbals.</p>

<p>In lecturing on the origin and growth of religion,
my chief object has been to show that a belief
in God, in the immortality of the soul, and in a future
retribution, can be gained, and not only can be, but
has been gained, by the right exercise of human
reason alone, without the assistance of what has been
called a special revelation. In doing this, I thought
I was simply following in the footsteps of the greatest
theologians of our time, and that I was serving the
cause of true religion by showing, by ample historical
evidence, gathered from the Sacred Books of the East,
how, what St. Paul, what the Fathers of the Church,
what mediæval theologians, and what some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
most learned of modern divines had asserted again
and again, was most strikingly confirmed by the
records of all non-Christian religions which have
lately become accessible to us. I could not have
believed it possible that, in undertaking this work, I
should have exposed myself to attacks from theologians
who profess and call themselves Christians, and who
yet maintain that worst of all heresies, that during all
the centuries that have elapsed and in all the countries
of the world, God has left Himself without a witness,
and has revealed Himself to one race only, the Jews
of Palestine.</p>

<p>If there is one thing which a comparative study of
religions places in the clearest light, it is the
inevitable decay to which every religion is exposed.
It may seem almost like a truism that no religion can
continue to be what it was during the lifetime of its
founders and its first apostles. Yet it is but seldom
borne in mind that without constant reformation,
<em>i.e.</em> without a constant return to its fountain head,
every religion&mdash;even the most perfect, on account of
its very perfection, more even than others&mdash;suffers
from its contact with the world, as the purest air
suffers from the mere fact of being breathed.</p>

<p class="sig">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>


<p>To each individual his own religion, if he really
believes in it, is something quite inseparable
from himself, something unique, that cannot be compared
to anything else, or replaced by anything else.
Our own religion is, in that respect, something like
our own language. In its form it may be like other
languages; in its essence, and in its relation to ourselves,
it stands alone and admits of no peer or rival.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Chips.</em>
</p>


<p>Three of the results to which, I believe, a comparative
study of religion is sure to lead, I may
here state:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. We shall learn that religions, in their most ancient
form, or in the minds of their authors, are generally free
from many of the blemishes that attach to them in later
times.</p>

<p>2. We shall learn that there is hardly one religion
which does not contain some truth, some important
truth; truth sufficient to enable those who seek the Lord,
and feel after Him, to find Him in their hour of need.</p>

<p>3. We shall learn to appreciate better than ever what
we have in our own religion. No one who has not
examined patiently and honestly the other religions of
the world can know what Christianity really is, or can
join with such truth and sincerity in the words of St. Paul,
'I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ.'</p></blockquote>

<p class="sig">
<em>Chips.</em>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>


<p>Many are the advantages to be derived from
a careful study of other religions, but the
greatest of all is that it teaches us to appreciate
more truly what we possess in our own. Let us see
what other nations have had and still have in the
place of religion, let us examine the prayers, the
worship, the theology even, of the most highly
civilised races, and we shall then understand more
thoroughly what blessings are vouchsafed to us in
being allowed to breathe from the first breath of life
the pure air of a land of Christian light and knowledge.
We are too apt to take the greatest blessings as
matters of course, and even religion forms no exception.
We have done so little to gain our religion,
we have suffered so little in the cause of truth, that
however highly we prize our own Christianity, we
never prize it highly enough until we have compared it
with the religions of the rest of the world.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Chips.</em>
</p>


<p>The spirit of truth is the life-spring of all religion,
and where it exists it must manifest itself, it
must plead, it must persuade, it must convince and
convert.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Chips.</em>
</p>


<p>As there is a faculty of speech, independent of all
the historical forms of language, there is a
faculty of faith in man, independent of all historical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
religions. If we say it is religion which distinguishes
man from the animal, we do not mean the Christian
and Jewish religion: we do not mean any special
religion: but we mean a mental faculty or disposition,
which, independent of, nay in spite of, sense and
reason, enables man to apprehend the Infinite under
different names, and under varying disguises. Without
that faculty, no religion, not even the lowest
worship of idols and fetishes, would be possible; and
if we will but listen attentively, we can hear in all
religions a groaning of the spirit, a struggle to
conceive the inconceivable, to utter the unutterable,
a longing after the Infinite, a love of God.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Science of Religion.</em>
</p>


<p>Like an old precious metal, the ancient religion,
after the dust of ages has been removed, will
come out in all its purity and brightness: and the
image which it discloses will be the image of the
Father, the Father of all the nations upon earth; and
the superscription, where we can read it again, will
be, not in Judæa only, but in the languages of all
the races of the world, the Word of God, revealed
where alone it can be revealed&mdash;revealed in the heart
of man.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Science of Religion.</em>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>


<p>If we granted that all religions, except Christianity
and Mosaism, derived their origin from those
faculties of the mind only which, according to Paley,
are sufficient by themselves for calling into life the
fundamental tenets of natural religion, the classification
of Christianity and Judaism on one side as
<em>revealed</em>, and of the other religions as <em>natural</em>, would
still be defective, for the simple reason that no religion,
though founded on revelation, can ever be entirely
separated from natural religion. The tenets of natural
religion, though they never constituted by themselves
a real historical religion, supply the only ground on
which even revealed religions can stand, the only soil
where they can strike root, and from which they can
receive nourishment and life.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Science of Religion.</em>
</p>


<p>The intention of religion, wherever we meet it,
is always holy. However imperfect, however
childish a religion may be, it always places the human
soul in the presence of God: and however imperfect
and however childish the conception of God may be,
it always represents the highest ideal of perfection
which the human soul, for the time being, can reach
and grasp. Religion therefore places the human soul
in the presence of its highest ideal, it lifts it above the
level of ordinary goodness, and produces at last a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
yearning after a higher and better life&mdash;a life in the
light of God.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Science of Religion.</em>
</p>


<p>I suppose that most of us, sooner or later in life,
have felt how the whole world&mdash;this wicked
world, as we call it&mdash;is changed as if by magic, if
once we can make up our mind to give men credit for
good motives, never to be suspicious, never to think
evil, never to think ourselves better than our neighbours.
Trust a man to be true and good, and, even
if he is not, your trust will tend to make him true and
good. It is the same with the religions of the world.
Let us but once make up our minds to look in them for
what is true and good, and we shall hardly know our
old religions again. There is no religion&mdash;or, if there
is, I do not know it&mdash;which does not say, 'Do good,
avoid evil.' There is none which does not contain
what Rabbi Hillel called the quintessence of all
religions, the simple warning, 'Be good, my boy.'
'Be good, my boy,' may seem a very short catechism,
but let us add to it, 'Be good, my boy, for God's
sake,' and we have in it very nearly the whole of the
Law and the Prophets.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Science of Religion.</em>
</p>


<p>In order to choose between different gods, and
different forms of faith, a man must possess the
faculty of choosing the instruments of testing truth and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
untruth, whether revealed or not; he must know that
certain fundamental tenets cannot be absent in any
true religion, and that there are doctrines against which
his rational or moral conscience revolts as incompatible
with truth. In short, there must be the foundation
of religion, there must be the solid rock, before it is
possible to erect an altar, a temple, or a church: and
if we call that foundation natural religion, it is clear
that no revealed religion can be thought of which does
not rest more or less firmly on natural religion.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Science of Religion.</em>
</p>


<p>Universal primeval revelation is only another
name for natural religion, and it rests on no
authority but the speculations of philosophers. The
same class of philosophers, considering that language
was too wonderful an achievement for the human
mind, insisted on the necessity of admitting a universal
primeval language, revealed directly by God to men,
or rather to mute beings: while the more thoughtful
and more reverent of the Fathers of the Church,
and among the founders of modern philosophy also,
pointed out that it was more consonant with the
general working of an all-wise and all-powerful
Creator that He should have endowed human nature
with the essential conditions of speech, instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
presenting mute beings with grammars and dictionaries
ready-made. The same applies to religion. A
universal primeval religion revealed direct by God to
man, or rather to a crowd of atheists, may, to our
human wisdom, seem the best solution of all difficulties;
but a higher wisdom speaks to us out of the
realities of history, and teaches us, if we will but
learn, that 'we have all to seek the Lord, if haply we
may feel after Him, and find Him, though He is not
far from every one of us.'</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Science of Religion.</em>
</p>


<p>The study of the ancient religions of mankind, I
feel convinced, if carried on in a bold, but
scholarlike, careful, and reverent spirit, will remove
many doubts and difficulties which are due entirely to
the narrowness of our religious horizon; it will enlarge
our sympathies, it will raise our thoughts above
the small controversies of the day, and at no distant
future evoke in the very heart of Christianity a fresh
spirit and a new life.</p>

<p>No judge, if he had before him the worst of
criminals, would treat him as most historians
and theologians have treated the religions of the
world. Every act in the lives of their founders which
shows that they were but men, is eagerly seized and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
judged without mercy; every doctrine that is not
carefully guarded is interpreted in the worst sense that
it will bear; every act of worship that differs from our
own way of serving God is held up to ridicule and
contempt. And this is not done by accident but with
a purpose, nay, with something of that artificial sense
of duty which stimulates the counsel for the defence to
see nothing but an angel in his own client, and anything
but an angel in the plaintiff on the other side.
The result has been&mdash;as it could not be otherwise&mdash;a
complete miscarriage of justice, an utter misapprehension
of the real character and purpose of the ancient
religions of mankind; and, as a necessary consequence,
a failure in discovering the peculiar features which
really distinguish Christianity from all the religions of
the world, and secure to its founder His own peculiar
place in the history of the world, far away from
Zoroaster and Buddha, from Moses and Mohammed,
from Confucius and Laotse. By unduly deprecating
all other religions we have placed our own in a
position which its founder never intended for it; we
have torn it away from the sacred context of the
history of the world; we have ignored, or wilfully
narrowed, the sundry times and divers manners in
which, in times past, God spake unto the fathers by
the prophets; and instead of recognising Christianity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
as coming in the fulness of time, and as the fulfilment
of the hopes and desires of the whole world, we
have brought ourselves to look upon its advent as the
only broken link in that unbroken chain which is
rightly called the Divine government of the world.
Nay, worse than this, there are people who, from
mere ignorance of the ancient religions of mankind,
have adopted a doctrine more unchristian than any
that could be found in the pages of the religious books
of antiquity, <em>i.e.</em> that all the nations of the earth,
before the rise of Christianity, were mere outcasts,
forsaken and forgotten of their Father in heaven,
without a knowledge of God, without a hope of
heaven. If a comparative study of the religions of
the world produced but this one result, that it drove
this godless heresy out of every Christian heart, and
made us see again in the whole history of the world
the eternal wisdom and love of God towards all His
creatures, it would have done a good work.</p>

<p>Do you still wonder at polytheism or at mythology?
Why, they are inevitable. They are, if you
like, a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parler enfantin</i> of religion. But the world has
its childhood, and when it was a child, it spoke as a
child, it understood as a child, it thought as a child,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
and in that it spoke as a child its language was true.
The fault rests with us, if we insist on taking the
language of children for the language of men, if we
attempt to translate literally ancient into modern
language, Oriental into Occidental speech, poetry into
prose.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Science of Religion.</em>
</p>


<p>Religion is inevitable if only we are left in
possession of our senses, such as we really find
them, not such as they have been defined for us. We
claim no special faculty, no special revelation. The
only faculty we claim is perception, the only revelation
we claim is history, or, as it is now called,
historical evolution. But let it not be supposed that
we find the idea of the Infinite ready made in the
human mind from the very beginning of our history.
All we maintain is that the germ or the possibility,
the Not-yet of that idea, lies hidden in the earliest
sensuous perceptions, and that as reason is evolved
from what is finite, so faith is evolved from what
from the very beginning is infinite in the perceptions
of our senses.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Hibbert Lectures.</em>
</p>


<p>Each religion has its own peculiar growth, but
the seed from which they spring is everywhere
the same. That seed is the perception of the infinite,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
from which no one can escape who does not wilfully
shut his eyes. From the first flutter of human consciousness,
that perception underlies all the other perceptions
of our senses, all our imaginings, all our
concepts, and every argument of our reason. It may
be buried for a time beneath the fragments of our
finite knowledge, but it is always there, and, if we dig
deep enough, we shall always find that buried seed,
supplying the living sap to the fibres and feeders of all
true faith.</p>

<p>Instead of approaching the religions of the world
with the preconceived idea that they are either
corruptions of the Jewish religion, or descended, in
common with the Jewish religion, from some perfect
primeval revelation, the students of the science of
religion have seen that it is their duty first to collect
all the evidence of the early history of religious
thought that is still accessible in the sacred books of
the world, or in the mythology, customs, or even in
the languages of various races. Afterwards they have
undertaken a genealogical classification of all the
materials that have hitherto been collected, and they
have then only approached the question of the origin
of religion in a new spirit, by trying to find out how
the roots of the various religions, the radical concepts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
which form their foundation, and before all, the
concept of the infinite, could have been developed,
taking for granted nothing but sensuous perception on
one side, and the world by which we are surrounded
on the other.</p>

<p class="sig">

<p>A distinction has been made for us between
religion and philosophy, and, so far as form
and object are concerned, I do not deny that such a
distinction may be useful. But when we look to the
subjects with which religion is concerned, they are,
and always have been, the very subjects on which
philosophy has dwelt, nay, from which philosophy has
sprung. If religion depends for its very life on the
sentiment or the perception of the infinite within the
finite and beyond the finite, who is to determine the
legitimacy of that sentiment, or of that perception, if
not the philosopher? Who is to determine the powers
which man possesses for apprehending the finite by his
senses, for working up his single, and therefore finite,
impressions into concepts by his reason, if not the
philosopher? And who, if not the philosopher, is to
find out whether man can claim the right of asserting
the existence of the infinite, in spite of the constant
opposition of sense and reason, taking these words in
their usual meaning? We should damnify religion if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
we separated it from philosophy: we should ruin
philosophy if we divorced it from religion.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Hibbert Lectures.</em>
</p>


<p>Who, if he is honest towards himself, could say
that the religion of his manhood was the
same as that of his childhood, or the religion of his
old age the same as the religion of his manhood? It
is easy to deceive ourselves, and to say that the most
perfect faith is a childlike faith. Nothing can be truer,
and the older we grow the more we learn to understand
the wisdom of a childlike faith. But before we
can learn that, we have first to learn another lesson,
namely, to put away childish things. There is the
same glow about the setting sun as there is about the
rising sun; but there lies between the two a whole
world, a journey through the whole sky, and over the
whole earth.</p>

<p>I hope the time will come when the subterranean
area of human religion will be rendered more
and more accessible, ... and that the Science of
Religion, which at present is but a desire and a seed,
will in time become a fulfilment, a plenteous harvest.
When that time of harvest has come, when the deepest
foundations of all the religions of the world have been
laid free and restored, who knows but that those very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
foundations may serve once more, like the catacombs,
or like the crypts beneath our old cathedrals, as a place
of refuge for those who, to whatever creed they may
belong, long for something better, purer, older, and
truer than what they can find in the statutable sacrifices,
services, and sermons of the days in which their
lot on earth has been cast; some who have learnt to
put away childish things, call them genealogies,
legends, miracles, or oracles, but who cannot part with
the childlike faith of their heart. Each believer may
bring down with him into that quiet crypt what he
values most, his own pearl of great price&mdash;the Hindu,
his innate disbelief in this world, his unhesitating
belief in another world; the Buddhist, his perception
of an eternal law, his submission to it, his gentleness,
his pity; the Mohammedan, if nothing else, his sobriety;
the Jew, his clinging through good and evil
days to the one God, who loveth righteousness and
whose name is 'I am'; the Christian, that which is
better than all, if those who doubt it would only try
it&mdash;our love of God, call Him what you like, the
infinite, the invisible, the immortal, the father, the
highest Self, above all, and through all, and in all,
manifested in our love of man, our love of the living,
our love of the dead, our living and undying love.</p>

<p>If we see the same doctrines, sometimes uttered
even in the very same words, by the Apostles,
and by what people call the false prophets, of the
heathen world, we need not grudge them these
precious pearls. When two religions say the same
thing, it is not always the same thing; but even if it
is, should we not rather rejoice and try with all our
might to add to what may be called the heavenly
dowry of the human race, the common stock of truth
which, as we are told, is not far from every one of
us, if only we feel after it and find it?</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, I.</em>
</p>


<p>Religion, when looked upon not as supernatural,
but as thoroughly natural to man, has assumed
a new meaning and a higher dignity when studied as
an integral part of that historical evolution which has
made man what he is, and what from the very first he
was meant to be. Is it no comfort to know that at no
time and in no part of the world, has God left Himself
without witness, that the hand of God was nowhere
beyond the reach of the outstretched hands of babes
and sucklings; nay, that it was from those rude
utterances out of the mouth of babes and sucklings,
that is, of savages and barbarians, that has been
perfected in time the true praise of God? To have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
looked for growth and evolution in history as well as
in nature is no blame, and has proved no loss to the
present or to the last century; and if the veil has as
yet been but little withdrawn from the Holy of Holies,
those who come after us will have learnt at least this
one lesson, that this lifting of the veil which was
supposed to be the privilege of priests, is no longer
considered as a sacrilege, if attempted by any honest
seekers after truth.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, I.</em>
</p>


<p>Religion consists in the perception of the infinite
under such manifestations as are able to influence
the moral character of man.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, I.</em>
</p>


<p>No opinion is true simply because it has been held
either by the greatest intellects or by the largest
number of human beings at different periods in the
history of the world. No one can spend years in the
study of the religions of the world, beginning with
the lowest and ending with the highest forms, no one
can watch the sincerity of religious endeavour, the
warmth of religious feeling, the nobleness of religious
conduct, among races whom we are inclined to call
pagan or savage, without learning at all events a
lesson of humility. Anybody, be he Jew, Christian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Mohammedan, or Brahman, if he has a spark of
modesty left, must feel that it would be nothing short
of a miracle that his own religion alone should be
perfect throughout, while that of every other believer
should be false or wrong from beginning to end.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, I.</em>
</p>


<p>The more we study the history of the religions of
the world, the clearer it becomes that there is
really no religion which could be called an individual
religion, in the sense of a religion created, as it were
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de novo</i>, or rather <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ab ovo</i>, by one single person.
This may seem strange, and yet it is really most
natural. Religion, like language, is everywhere an
historical growth, and to invent a completely new
religion would be as hopeless a task as to invent a
completely new language. Nor do the founders of
the great historical religions of the world ever claim
this exclusive authorship. On the contrary, most of
them disclaim in the strongest terms the idea that they
have come either to destroy, or to build a completely
new temple.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, I.</em>
</p>


<p>The whole world in its wonderful history has
passed through the struggle for life, the struggle
for eternal life; and every one of us, in his own not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
less wonderful history, has had to pass through the
same wonderful struggle: for, without it, no religion,
whatever its sacred books may be, will find in any
human heart that soil in which alone it can strike root
and on which alone it can grow and bear fruit. We
must all have our own bookless religion, if the sacred
books, whatever they may be, are to find a safe and
solid foundation within ourselves. No temple can
stand without that foundation, and it is because that
foundation is so often neglected that the walls of the
temple become unsafe and threaten to fall.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, I.</em>
</p>


<p>The heart and mind and soul of man are the same
under every sky, in all the varying circumstances
of human life; and it would be awful to believe that
<em>any</em> human beings should have been deprived of that
light 'which lighteth <em>every</em> man that cometh into the
world.' It is that light which lighteth every man, and
which has lighted all the religions of the world, call
them bookless or literate, human or divine, natural or
supernatural, which alone can dispel the darkness of
doubt and fear that has come over the world. What
our age wants more than anything else is <em>Natural
Religion</em>. Whatever meaning different theologians
may attach to <em>Supernatural Religion</em>, history teaches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
us that nothing is so natural as the supernatural. But
the supernatural must always be <em>superimposed</em> on the
natural. Supernatural religion without natural religion
is a house built on sand, and when, as in our days,
the rain of doubt descends, and the floods of criticism
come, and the winds of unbelief and despair blow and
beat upon that house, that house will fall because it was
not founded on the rock of bookless religion, of natural
religion, of eternal religion.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, I.</em>
</p>


<p>Every religion, being the property of the young
and the old, the wise and the foolish, must always
be a kind of compromise, and, while protesting against
real corruptions and degradations, we must learn to
bear with those whose language differs from our
own, and trust that in spite of the tares which have
sprung up during the night, some grains of wheat
will ripen towards the harvest in every honest heart.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, II.</em>
</p>


<p>In all the fundamentals of religion we are neither
better nor worse than our neighbours, neither
more wise nor more unwise than all the members of
that great family who have been taught to know
themselves as children of one and the same Father in
Heaven.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, II.</em>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>


<p>What can a study of Natural Religion teach us?
Why, it teaches us that religion is natural, is
real, is inevitable, is universal. Is that nothing? Is
it nothing to know that there is a solid rock on which
all religion, call it natural or supernatural, is founded?
Is it nothing to learn from the annals of history that
God has not left Himself without witness in that He
did good, and gave us rain from heaven and fruitful
seasons, filling our hearts, and the hearts of the whole
human race, with food and gladness?</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, II.</em>
</p>


<p>While on the one side a study of Natural
Religion teaches us that much of what we
are inclined to class as natural, to accept as a matter
of course, is in reality full of meaning, is full of God,
is in fact truly miraculous, it also opens our eyes to
another fact, namely, that many things which we are
inclined to class as supernatural, are in reality perfectly
natural, perfectly intelligible, nay inevitable, in the
growth of every religion.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, II.</em>
</p>


<p>The real coincidences between all the religions of
the world teach us that all religions spring
from the same soil&mdash;the human heart; that they all
look to the same ideals, and that they are all surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
by the same dangers and difficulties. Much
that is represented to us as supernatural in the annals
of the ancient religions of the world becomes perfectly
natural from this point of view.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, II.</em>
</p>


<p>To those who see no difficulties in their own
religion, the study of other religions will create
no new difficulties. It will only help them to appreciate
more fully what they already possess. For with
all that I have said in order to show that other
religions also contain all that is necessary for salvation,
it would be simply dishonest on my part were I
to hide my conviction that the religion taught by
Christ, free as yet from all ecclesiastical fences
and entrenchments, is the best, the purest, the truest
religion the world has ever seen.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, II.</em>
</p>


<p>To expect that religion could ever be placed again
beyond the reach of scientific treatment or
honest criticism, shows an utter misapprehension of
the signs of the times, and would, after all, be no
more than to set up private judgment against private
judgment. If the inalienable rights of private judgment,
that is, of honesty and truth, were more generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
recognised, the character of religious controversy
would at once be changed. It is restriction that
provokes resentment, and thus embitters all discussions
on religious subjects.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, III.</em>
</p>


<p>So far from being dishonest, the distinction between
a higher and a lower form of religion
is in truth the only honest recognition of the realities
of life. If to a philosophic mind religion is a
spiritual love of God, and the joy of his full consciousness
of the spirit of God within him, what meaning
can such words convey to the millions of human
beings who nevertheless want a religion, a positive,
authoritative, or revealed religion, to teach them that
there is a God, and that His commands must be
obeyed without questioning?</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, III.</em>
</p>


<p>People ask what can be gained by a comprehensive
study of religions, by showing that, as yet,
no race has been discovered without some word for
what is not visible, not finite, not human, for something
superhuman and divine. Some theologians go
even so far as to resent the discovery of the universality
of such a belief. They are anxious to prove
that human reason alone could never have arrived at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
a conception of God. They would much rather
believe that God has left Himself without witness than
that a belief in something higher than the Finite
could spring up in the human heart from gratitude
to Him who gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful
seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, III.</em>
</p>


<p>Physical religion, beginning in a belief in
agents behind the great phenomena of nature,
reached its highest point when it had led the human
mind to a belief in one Supreme Agent or God,
whatever his name might be. It was supposed that
this God could be implored by prayers and pleased by
sacrifices. He was called the father of gods and
men. Yet even in his highest conception, he was no
more than what Cardinal Newman defined God to be.
'I mean by the Supreme Being,' he wrote, 'one who
is simply self-dependent, and the only being who is
such. I mean that he created all things out of
nothing, and could destroy them as easily as he
made them, and that, in consequence, he is separated
from them by an abyss, and incommunicable in all
his attributes.' This abyss separating God from
man remains at the end of Physical Religion. It
constitutes its inherent weakness. But this very weakness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
becomes in time a source of strength, for from it
sprang a yearning for better things. Even the God
of the Jews, in His unapproachable majesty, though
He might be revered and loved by man during His
life on earth, could receive, as it were, a temporary
allegiance only, for 'the dead cannot praise God,
neither any that go down into darkness!' God was
immortal, a man was mortal; and Physical Religion
could not throw a bridge over the abyss that separated
the two. Real religion, however, requires more
than a belief in God, it requires a belief in man also,
and an intimate relation between God and man, at
all events in a life to come. There is in man an
irrepressible desire for continued existence. It shows
itself in life in what we may call self-defence. It
shows itself at the end of life and at the approach of
death, in the hope of immortality.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, III.</em>
</p>


<p>So long as we look on the history of the human
race as something that might or might not have
been, we cannot wonder that the student of religion
should prefer to form his opinions of the nature of
religion and the laws of its growth from the masterpiece
of Thomas Aquinas, the <cite>Summa Sacræ Theologiæ</cite>,
rather than from the <cite>Sacred Books of the East</cite>. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
when we have learnt to recognise in history the
realisation of a rational purpose, when we have learnt
to look upon it as in the truest sense of the word a
Divine Drama, the plot revealed in it ought to assume
in the eyes of a philosopher also, a meaning and a
value far beyond the speculations of even the most
enlightened and logical theologians.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, IV.</em>
</p>


<p>The question is whether there is, or whether there
is not, hidden in every one of the sacred books,
something that could lift up the human heart from
this earth to a higher world, something that could
make man feel the omnipresence of a higher Power,
something that could make him shrink from evil and
incline to good, something to sustain him in the short
journey through life, with its bright moments of
happiness, and its long hours of terrible distress.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Preface, Sacred Books of the East.</em>

</p>


<p>It has been truly said, and most emphatically, by
Dr. Newman, that neither a belief in God by
itself, nor a belief in the soul by itself, would constitute
religion, and that real religion is founded on a
true perception of the relation of the soul to God,
and of God to the soul.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, IV.</em>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>


<p>It may be truly said that the founders of the
religions of the world have all been bridge-builders.
As soon as the existence of a Beyond, of
a Heaven above the earth, of Powers above us and
beneath us, had been recognised, a great gulf seemed
to be fixed between what was called by various names,
the earthly and the heavenly, the material and the
spiritual, the phenomenal and nomenal, or best of
all, the visible and invisible world, and it was the
chief object of religion to unite these two worlds
again, whether by the arches of hope and fear, or
by the iron chains of logical syllogisms.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, IV.</em>
</p>


<p>Religion, in order to be <em>real</em> religion, a man's
own religion, must be searched for, must be
discovered, must be conquered. If it is simply
inherited, or accepted as a matter of course, it often
happens that in later years it falls away, and has
either to be reconquered, or to be replaced by another
religion.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Autobiography.</em>
</p>


<p>Religion is growth, never finished. From the
lowest to the highest stages it is growth, not
willed only, nor given only, but both. The lowest
stages may seem very imperfect to us, but they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
all the more important. Language and mythology
show us the old path on which man travelled from
Nature to God.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>MS.</em>
</p>


<p>There is no lesson which at the present time
seems more important than to learn that in
every religion there are precious grains; that we
must draw in every religion a broad distinction
between what is essential and what is not, between
the eternal and the temporary, between the divine
and the human, and that though the non-essential
may fill many volumes, the essential can often be
comprehended in a few words, but words on which
'hang all the law and the prophets.'</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Preface, Sacred Books of the East.</em>
</p>


<p>Religions were meant to be many, like languages.
To us, one language for the whole human race
would seem to be far better; but it was not to be.
Each language was to be a school for each race, a
talent committed to each nation. And so it is with
religion. There is truth in all of them, the whole
truth in none. Let each one cherish his own, purify
his own, and throw away what is dead and decaying.
But to give up one's religion is like giving up one's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
life. Even the lowest savage must keep his own
old faith in God, when he becomes converted to
Christianity, or he will have lost the living and life-giving
root of his faith. If people would only learn to
look for what is good in all religions, how far more
beautiful the world would appear in their eyes. They
dig hard enough to get the ore from out a mine,
they sift it, smelt it, purify it, and then keep the
small pieces of gold they have got with all this
trouble, forgetting the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scoriae</i> and all the refuse.
That is what we must do as students of religion;
but we do the very contrary&mdash;we hug the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scoriae</i> and
shut our eyes to the glittering rays of gold. Jews
and Christians are worse in that respect than all other
people. It may be because their religions are freer
from human impurities than all other religions. But
why should that make them blind to what is really
good in other religions, why should it blind them so
much that they look upon other religions as the work
of the Devil? The power of evil has had its work
in all religions, our own not excepted&mdash;but the power
of goodness prevails everywhere. Till we know
that, life and history seem intolerable. It would not
put an end to missionary labour, it would only make
it more a labour of love, less painful to those whom
we wish to win, not away from their God, but back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
to their God, Him whom they ignorantly worship,
and whom we should declare unto them, according
to our own light, such as it is, less dark than theirs
on many points, but yet dark, as those know best
who, like St. Paul, have striven hardest to look
through the glass of our own weak human mind.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>MS.</em>
</p>


<p>If people would only learn to see that there is really
a religion beyond all religions, that each man
must have his own religion which he has conquered
for himself, and that we must learn to tolerate religion
wherever we find it! Christianity would be a perfect
religion, if it did not go beyond the simple words
of Christ, and if, even in these words, we made full
allowance for the time and place and circumstances
in which they were spoken&mdash;that is, if we simply
followed Christ where He wishes us to follow Him.
We have gone far beyond those times and circumstances
in many things, but in what is most essential
we are still far behind the teaching of Christ. How
many call themselves Christians who have no idea
how difficult it is to be a Christian, a follower of
Christ! It is easy enough to repeat creeds, and to
work ourselves into a frame of mind when miracles
seem most easy.</p>

<p>It was the duty of the Apostles and of the early
Christians in general to stand forth in the name
of the only true God, and to prove to the world that
their God had nothing in common with the idols
worshipped at Athens and Ephesus. It was the duty
of the early converts to forswear all allegiance to
their former deities, and if they could not at once
bring themselves to believe that the gods whom they
had worshipped had no existence at all, they were
naturally led on to ascribe to them a kind of
demoniacal nature, and to curse them as the offspring
of that new principle of Evil with which they
had become acquainted in the doctrines of the early
Church.... Through the whole of St. Augustine's
works, and through all the works of earlier Christian
divines, there runs the same spirit of hostility blinding
them to all that may be good, and true, and sacred,
and magnifying all that is bad, false, and corrupt, in
the ancient religions of mankind. Only the Apostles
and their immediate disciples venture to speak in a
different and, no doubt, in a more truly Christian spirit
of the old forms of worships.... What can be more
convincing, more powerful, than the language of St.
Paul at Athens?</p>

<p>Those who believe that there is a God, and that
He created heaven and earth, and that He
ruleth the world by His unceasing providence, cannot
believe that millions of human beings, all created like
ourselves in the image of God, were, in their time of
ignorance, so utterly abandoned that their whole
religion was falsehood, their whole worship a farce,
their whole life a mockery. An honest and independent
study of the religions of the world will teach
us that it was not so, ... that there is no religion
which does not contain some grains of truth. Nay,
it will teach us more; it will teach us to see in the
history of the ancient religions, more clearly than
anywhere else, the <em>Divine education of the human
race</em>.</p>

<p class="sig">

<p>The Divine, if it is to reveal itself at all to us,
will best reveal itself in our own human form.
However far the human may be from the Divine,
nothing on earth is nearer to God than man, nothing
on earth more godlike than man. And as man grows
from childhood to old age, the idea of the Divine
must grow with us from the cradle to the grave,
from grace to grace. A religion which is not able
thus to grow and live with us as we grow and live,
is dead already. Definite and unvarying uniformity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
so far from being a sign of honesty and life, is
always a sign of dishonesty and death. Every
religion, if it is to be a bond between the wise and
the foolish, the old and the young, must be pliant,
must be high and deep and broad; bearing all things,
believing all things, hoping all things, enduring all
things. The more it is so, the greater its vitality,
the greater the strength and warmth of its embrace.</p>

<h2>REVELATION</h2>


<p>True inspiration is, and always has been, the
spirit of truth within, and this is but another
name for the spirit of God. It is truth that makes
inspiration, not inspiration that makes truth. Whoever
knows what truth is knows also what inspiration
is: not only <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">theopneustos</i>, blown into the soul by God,
but the very voice of God, the real presence of God,
the only presence in which we, as human beings, can
ever perceive Him.</p>

<p class="sig">

</p>


<p>There is nothing in the idea of revelation that
excludes progress, for whatever definition of
revelation we may adopt, it always represents a communication
between the Divine on one side and the
Human on the other. Let us grant that the Divine
element in revelation, that is, whatever of truth there
is in revelation, is immutable, yet the human element,
the recipient, must always be liable to the accidents
and infirmities of human nature. That human element
can never be eliminated in any religion.... To ignore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
that human element in all religions is like ignoring
the eye as the recipient and determinant of the colours
of light. We know more of the sun than our forefathers,
though the same sun shone on them that
shines on us; and if astronomy has benefited by its
telescopes, ... theology also ought not to despise
whatever can strengthen the far-sightedness of human
reason in its endeavour to gain a truer and purer idea
of the Divine. A veil will always remain. But as
in every other pursuit, so in religion also, we want
less and less of darkness, more and more of light;
we want, call it life, or growth, or development, or
progress; we do not want mere rest, mere stagnation,
mere death.</p>

<p>It was the sense of an overpowering truth which
led to the admission of a revelation. But while
in the beginning truth made revelation, it soon
came to pass that revelation was supposed to make
truth. When we see this happening in every part of
the world, when we can watch the psychological progress
which leads in the most natural way to a belief
in supernatural inspiration, it will hardly be said that
an historical study of religion may be useful to the
antiquarian, but cannot help us to solve the burning
questions of the day.</p>

<p>I believe in one revelation only&mdash;the revelation
within us, which is much better than any revelations
which come from without. Why should we
look for God and listen for His voice outside us only,
and not within us? Where is the temple of God,
or the true kingdom of God?</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Life.</em>
</p>


<p>There are Christian mystics who would not place
internal revelation, or the voice of God within
the heart, so far below external revelation. To those
who know the presence of God within the heart, this
revelation is far more real than any other can be.
They hold with St. Paul that man is in the full sense
of the word the temple of God, and that the Spirit of
God dwelleth within him, nay, they go even further,
and both as Christians and as mystics they cling to
the belief that all men are one in the Father and the
Son, as the Father is in the Son, and the Son in the
Father. There is no conflict in their minds between
Christian doctrine and mystic doctrine. They are one
and the same in character, the one imparted through
Christ on earth, the other imparted through the indwelling
spirit of God, which again is Christ, as born
within us. The Gospel of St. John is full of passages
to which the Christian mystic clings, and by which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
justifies his belief in the indwelling spirit of God, or,
as he also calls it, the birth of Christ in the human
soul.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, II.</em>
</p>


<p>I cannot connect any meaning with a primeval
revelation, or with an original knowledge of
God. A knowledge of God is surely at all times impossible;
man can only trust, he cannot know. He
can feel the Infinite, and the Divine, he can never
class it or subdue it by knowledge. The question
seems to me, how our unconscious relation to God,
which must be there and can never be destroyed,
becomes gradually more and more conscious; and that
is what one can best learn to understand in the history
of the various religions of the world&mdash;so many
voyages of discovery, each full of sufferings and
heroic feats, all looking towards the same Pole, each
to be judged by itself, none, I believe, to be condemned
altogether.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>MS.</em>
</p>


<p>To assume that every word, every letter, every
parable, every figure was whispered to the
authors of the Gospels, is certainly an absurdity, and
rests only on human ... authority. But the true
revelation, the real truth, as it was already anticipated
by the Greek philosophers, slowly accepted by Jews,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
like Philo and the contemporaries of Jesus, taught by
men like Clement and Origen in the ancient Greek
Church, and, in fine, realised in the life of Jesus, and
sealed by His death, is no absurdity: it is for every
thinking Christian the eternal life, or the Kingdom of
God on earth, which Jesus wished to establish, and in
part did establish. To become a citizen of this Kingdom
is the highest that man can attain, but it is not
attained merely through baptism and confirmation; it
must be gained in earnest spiritual conflict.</p>

<h2>THE RIG-VEDA</h2>


<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Veda</i> alone of all works I know treats of a
genesis of God-consciousness, compared to
which the Theogony of Hesiod is like a worn-out
creature. We see it grow slowly and gradually with
all its contradictions, its sudden terrors, its amazements,
and its triumphs. As God reveals His Being
in nature in her order, her indestructibility, in the
eternal victory of light over darkness, of spring over
winter, in the eternally returning course of the sun
and the stars, so man has gradually spelt out of
nature the Being of God, and after trying a thousand
names for God in vain, we find Him in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Veda</i> already
saying: 'They call him Indra, Mitra, Varuna; then
they call him the Heavenly, the bird with beautiful
wings; that which is One they call in various ways.'...
The belief in Immortality is only the other side,
as it were, of the God-consciousness, and both are
originally natural to the Aryan race.</p>

<h2>SCIENCE</h2>


<p>Every true Science is like a hardy Alpine guide
that leads us on from the narrow, though it
may be the more peaceful and charming, valleys of our
preconceived opinions, to higher points, apparently
less attractive, nay often disappointing for a time, till,
after hours of patient and silent climbing, we look
round and see a new world around us.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Chips.</em>
</p>


<p>A new horizon has opened, our eyes see far and
wide, and as the world beneath us grows wider
and larger, our own hearts seem to grow wider and
larger, and we learn to embrace the far and distant,
and all that before seemed strange and indifferent,
with a warmer recognition and a deeper human
sympathy; we form wider concepts, we perceive
higher truths.</p>

<p>Man is the measurer of all things; and what is
Science but the reflection of the outer world
on the mirror of the mind, growing more perfect,
more orderly, more definite, more great, with every
generation? To attempt to study nature without
studying man is as impossible as to study light without
studying the eye. I have no misgivings, therefore,
that the lines on which this College (Mason
Science College) is founded will ever become so
narrow as to exclude the science of man, and the
science of that which makes man, the science of
language, and, what is really the same, the science of
thought. And where can we study the science of
thought, that most wonderful instance of development,
except in the languages and literatures of the past?
How are we to do justice to our ancestors except by
letting them plead their own case in their own
language? Literary culture can far better dispense
with physical science than physical science with
literary culture, though nothing is more satisfactory
than a perfect combination of the two.</p>

<h2>THE SELF</h2>


<p>As behind the various gods of nature, one supreme
deity was at last discovered in India, the Brahmans
imagined that they perceived behind the different
manifestations of feeling, thought, and will also, a
supreme power which they called Atma, or Self, and
of which the intellectual powers or faculties were but
the outward manifestations. This led to a philosophy
which took the place of religion, and recognised in
the self the only true being, the unborn and therefore
immortal element in man. A step further led to the
recognition of the original identity of the subjective
Self in man, and the objective Self in nature, and thus,
from an Indian point of view, to a solution of all the
riddles of the world. The first commandment of all
philosophy, 'Know thyself,' became in the philosophy
of the Upanishads, 'Know thyself as the Self,' or, if
we translate it into religious language, 'Know that we
live and move and have our being in God.'</p>

<p>The death of a child is as if the flash of the Divine
eye had turned quickly away from the mirror of
this world, before the human consciousness woke up
and thought it recognised itself in the mirror, often only
to perceive for a moment, just as it closes its eyes for
the last time, that that which it took for itself was the
shadow or reflection of its eternal self.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Life.</em>
</p>


<p>A man need not go into a cave because he has
found his true Self; he may live and act like
everybody else; he is 'living but free.' All remains
just the same, except the sense of unchangeable, imperishable
self which lifts him above the phenomenal
self. He knows he is wearing clothes, that is all. If
a man does not see it, if some of his clothes stick to
him like his very skin, if he fears he might lose his
identity by not being a male instead of a female, by
not being English instead of German, by not being a
child instead of a man, he must wait and work on.
Good works lead to quietness of mind, and quietness
of mind to true self-knowledge. Is it so very little to
be only Self, to be the subject that can resist, i.e. perceive
the whole universe, and turn it into his object?
Can we wish for more than what we are, lookers-on&mdash;resisting
what tries to crush us, call it force, or evil,
or anything else?</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Life.</em>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>


<p>The impression made on me by the look of a child
who is not yet conscious of himself and of the
world round him is that of still undisturbed godliness.
Only when self-consciousness wakes little by little,
through pleasure or pain, when the spirit accustoms
itself to its bodily covering, when man begins to say <em>I</em>
and the world to call things <em>his</em>, then the full separation
of the human self from the Divine begins, and it
is only after long struggles that the light of <em>true</em> self-consciousness
sooner or later breaks through the
clouds of earthly semblances, and makes us again
like the little children 'of whom is the Kingdom of
Heaven.' In God we live and move and have our
being, that is the sum of all human wisdom, and he
who does not find it here, will find it in another life.
All else that we learn on earth, be it the history of
nature or of mankind, is for this end alone, to show
us everywhere the presence of a Divine providence,
and to lead us through the knowledge of the history
of the human spirit to the knowledge of ourselves,
and through the knowledge of the laws of nature to
the understanding of that human nature to which we
are subjected in life.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Life.</em>
</p>


<p>To my mind the birth of a child is not a breach of
the law of continuity, but on that very ground
I must admit the previous existence of the Self that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
here born as a child, and which brings with it into
this new order of things simply its Self-consciousness,
and even that not developed but undeveloped potentia,
in a sleep. When afterwards a child awakes to self-consciousness,
that is really its remembrance of its former
existence. The Self which it becomes conscious of,
remember, is in its essence not of this world only, but
of a former as well as of a future world. This constitutes
in fact the only distinct remembrance in every
human being of a former life. There are besides
indistinct remembrances of his former existence, viz.
the many dispositions which every thinking man finds
in himself, and which are not simply the result of the
impressions of this world on a so-called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabula rasa</i>.
Unless we begin life as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabula rasa</i> we begin it as
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabula preparata</i>, as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">leukomata</i>, and whatever colour or
disposition, or talent, or temperament, whatever there
is inexplicable in each individual, that he will perceive,
or possibly remember, as the result of the continuity
between his present and former life.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>MS.</em>
</p>


<p>What, then, is that which we call Death?
Separation of the Self from a living body.
If so, does the body die because the Self leaves it, or
does the Self leave the body because it dies? What
has life to do with the Self? Has the Self which for
a time dwells in a living body anything to do with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
what we call the life of that body? Does the Self
take possession of a body because it lives, or does the
body live because the Self has taken possession of it?
The difficulty arises from our vague conception of <em>life</em>.
Life is only a mode of existence. Existence is possible
without what we call life, not life without existence.
To live means to be able to absorb, but who or what
is able? The Self exists, it is sentient, capable of
perception by becoming embodied. It is perceptive
because sentient, it is conceptive because perceptive.
The difficulty lies in the embodiment. It is there
where all philosophy becomes ridiculous.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>MS.</em>
</p>


<p>Knowledge belongs to the Self alone, call it
what we will. The nerve fibres might vibrate
as often as they pleased, millions and millions of times
in a second; they could never produce the sensation
of red if there were no Self as the receiver and
illuminator, the translator of these vibrations of ether;
this Self that alone receives, alone illumines, alone
knows, and of which we can say nothing more than
that it exists, that it perceives, and as the Indian
philosophers add, that it is blessed, <em>i.e.</em> that it is complete
in itself, serene, and eternal.</p>

<p>Nothing eternal can have a beginning, and
there can be no immortal life after death,
unless our true immortal life has been realised here

had realised their true, immortal, eternal, or divine
Self 'free while living.'</p>

<h2>SORROW AND SUFFERING</h2>


<p>How mysterious all this suffering is, particularly
when it produces such prostration that it must
lose all that elevating power which one knows suffering
does exercise in many cases. It seems sometimes as
if a large debt of suffering had to be paid off, and that
some are chosen to pay a large, very large sum, so
that others may go free. We have our own burden
to bear, but it is a burden that seems to make other
things easy to bear&mdash;it strengthens even when it
seems to crush. But how could one bear that complete
prostration of all powers which must make death
seem so much preferable to life. And yet life goes on,
and people care about a hundred little things, and break
their hearts if they do not get them.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>MS.</em>
</p>


<p>Such trials as you have had to pass through are
not sent without a purpose, and if you say that
they have changed your views of life, such a change
in a character like yours can only be a change in
advance, a firmer faith in those truths which have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
been revealed to the dim sight of human nature, a
stronger will to resist all falsehood and tampering
with the truth, and a deeper conviction that we owe
our life to Him who has given it, and that we must
fight His battle when He calls us to do it.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>MS.</em>
</p>


<p>God knows that we want rain and storm as much
as sunshine, and He sends us both as seems
best to His love and wisdom. When all breaks down
He lifts us up. But when we feel quite crushed and
forsaken and alone, we then feel the real presence of
our truest Friend, who, whether by joys or sorrows, is
always calling us to Him, and leading us to that true
Home where we shall find Him, and in Him all we
loved, with Him all we believed, and through Him all
we hoped for and aspired to on earth. Our broken
hearts are the truest earnest of everlasting life.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Life.</em>
</p>

<p>We must submit, but we must feel it a great
blessing to be able to submit, to be able to
trust that infinite Love which embraces us on all sides,
which speaks to us through every flower and every
worm, which always shows us beauty and perfection,
which never mars, never destroys, never wastes, never
deceives, never mocks.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>MS.</em>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>


<p>There is but one help and one comfort in these
trials, that is, to know by whom they are sent.
If one knows that nothing can happen to us without
Him, one does not feel quite helpless, even under the
greatest terrors of this life.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>MS.</em>
</p>


<p>How little one thinks that many trials and
afflictions may come upon us any day. One
lives as if life were to last for ever, and as if we
should never part with those who are most dear to
us. Life would be intolerable were it otherwise,
but how little one is prepared for what life really is.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>MS.</em>
</p>


<p>Why is there so much suffering in this world?
I cannot think it improves us much, and yet
it must have its purpose. All these are questions
far too high for us&mdash;we are like children, and more
than children, when we come to think of them. All
we know is that where we catch a glimpse of God's
handiwork, either in the natural or moral world, it
is so wonderfully perfect, so beyond all our measures,
that we feel safe as in a good ship, however rough
the sea may be. Whatever we may believe, or hope,
or wish for, will be far exceeded by that Higher Will
and Wisdom which supports all, even us little souls.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>MS.</em>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>


<p>The sorrows of life are inevitable, but they are
hard to bear, for all that. They would be
harder still if we did not see their purpose of
reminding us that our true life is not here, but that
we are here on a voyage that may be calm or stormy,
and which is to teach us what all sailors have to
learn, courage, perseverance, kindness, and in the
end complete trust in a Higher Power.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>MS.</em>
</p>


<p>Sorrow is necessary and good for men; one
learns to understand that each joy must be
indemnified by suffering, that each new tie which
knits our hearts to this life must be loosed again,
and the tighter and the closer it was knit, the keener
the pain of loosening it. Should we then attach
our hearts to nothing, and pass quietly and unsympathetically
through this world, as if we had
nothing to do with it? We neither could nor ought
to act so. Nature itself knits the first tie between
parents and children, and new ties through our whole
life. We are not here for reward, for the enjoyment
of undisturbed peace or from mere accident, but for
trial, for improvement, perhaps for punishment; for
the only union which can secure the happiness of
men, the union between our Self and God's Self, is
broken, or at least obscured, by our birth, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
highest object of our life is to find this bond again,
to remain ever conscious of it and hold fast to it in
life and in death. This rediscovery of the eternal
union between God and man constitutes true religion
among all people.</p>

<p>Every one carries a grave of lost hope in his
soul, but he covers it over with cold marble,
or with green boughs. On sad days one likes to go
alone to this God's acre of the soul, and weep there,
but only in order to return full of comfort and hope
to those who are left to us.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Life.</em>
</p>


<p>The sorrows of life, like all other things, pass
away, and the larger the number who await
us beyond, the easier the parting from those we leave
behind.</p>

<p>Grief is a sweet remembrance of happiness that
was.</p>

<p class="sig">

</p>


<p>There is the old riddle always before me, why
was ... taken from me? Human understanding
has no answer for it, and yet I feel as
certain as I can feel of anything that as it is, it is
good, it is best, better than anything I can wish for.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
One feels one's own ignorance why what seems so
right and natural should not be, and yet one knows
it could not be. One hides one's head in the arms
of a Higher Power, a Friend, a Father, and more
than a Father. Wait, and you will know. Work,
and you will be able to bear it.</p>

<p class="sig">

<p>People think that grief is pain, but it is not so:
Grief, the absorption in the quiet recollection
of what was, but is no longer, is a pleasure, a consolation,
a blessing.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>MS.</em>
</p>


<p>Those who would comfort us by bidding us
forget our grief, and join their happy gatherings,
do not know what comfort is. Hearts which
have suffered have a right to what the world may
call grief and sorrow, but what is really a quiet
communion with those whom we love, and whom
we can find no longer among the laughter of the
happy.</p>

<p class="sig">

<p>What can we pray for? Not for special gifts,
but only for God's mercy. We do not know
what is good for us, and for others. What would
become of the world if all our prayers were granted?
And yet it is good to pray&mdash;that is, to live in all
our joys and sorrows with God, that unknown God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
whom we cannot reason with, but whom we can love
and trust. Human misery, outward and inward, is
certainly a great problem, and yet one knows from
one's own life how just the heaviest burdens have
been blessings. The soul must be furrowed if it is
to bear fruit.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>MS.</em>
</p>


<p>What is the tenure of all our happiness? Are
we not altogether at the mercy of God?
Would it not be fearful to live for one day unless
we knew, and saw, and felt His Presence and Wisdom
and Love encompassing us on all sides? If we once
feel that, then even death, even the death of those
we love best and who love us best, loses much of
its terror: it is part and parcel of one great system
of which we see but a small portion here, and which
without death, without that bridge of which we see
here but the first arch, would seem to be a mere
mockery. That is why I said to you it is well that
human art cannot prolong our life for ever, and in
that sentiment I should think we both agree. I
have felt much for you, more than I cared to say.
We are trained differently, but we are all trained for
some good purpose, and the suffering which you have
undergone is to me like deep ploughing, the promise
of a rich harvest.</p>

<p>There is a large and secret brotherhood in this
world, the members of which easily recognise
each other, without any visible outward sign. It is
the band of mourners. The members of this brotherhood
need not necessarily wear mourning; they can
even rejoice with the joyful, and they seldom sigh or
weep when others see them. But they recognise and
understand each other, without uttering a word, like
tired wanderers who, climbing a steep mountain,
overtake other tired wanderers, and pause, and then
silently go on again, knowing that they all hope to
see the same glorious sunset high up above. Their
countenances reflect a soft moonlight; when they
speak, one thinks of the whispering of the leaves of
a beech forest after a warm spring shower, and as
the rays of the sun light up the drops of dew with
a thousand colours, and drink them up from the green
grass, a heavenly light seems to shine through the
tears of the mourners, to lighten them, and lovingly
kiss them away. Almost every one, sooner or later,
enters this brotherhood, and those who enter it early
may be considered fortunate, for they learn, before
it is too late, that <em>all</em> which man calls his own is only
lent him for a short time, and the ivy of their affections
does not cling so deeply and so strongly to the old
walls of earthly happiness.</p>

<p>We cannot know, we cannot name the Divine,
nor can we understand its ways as manifested
in nature and human life. We ask why there should
be suffering and sin, we cannot answer the question.
All we can say is, it is willed to be so. Some help
our human understanding may find, however, by
simply imagining what would have been our life if
the power of evil had not been given us. It seems
to me that in that case we, human beings as we are,
should never have had a conception of what is meant
by good: we should have been like the birds in the
air, happier, it may be, but better, no. Or if suffering
had always been reserved for the bad, we should all
have become the most cunning angels. Often when
I am met by a difficulty which seems insoluble, I try
that experiment, and say, Let us see what would
happen if it were otherwise. Still, I confess there is
some suffering on earth which goes beyond all understanding,
which even the truest Christian love and
charity seems unable to remove or mitigate. It can
teach us one thing only, that we are blind, and that
in the darkness of the night we lose our faith in a
Dawn which will drive away darkness, fear, and
despair. Much, no doubt, could be done even by
what is now called Communism, but what in earlier
days was called Christianity. And then one wonders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
whether the world can ever again become truly
Christian. I dare not call myself a Christian. I
have hardly met the men in all my life who deserved
that name. Again, I say, let us do our best, knowing
all the time that our best is a mere nothing.</p>

<h2>THE SOUL</h2>


<p>The name of the immortal element (in man) was
not given to man as a gratuitous gift. It had
to be gained, like the name of God, in the sweat of
his face. Before man could say that he believed his
soul to be immortal, he had to discover that there was
a soul in man. It required as great an effort to form
such a word as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">anima</i>, breath, and to make it signify
the infinite in man, as to form such a word as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">diva</i>,
bright, and to make it signify the infinite in nature.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, III.</em>
</p>


<p>To us the two words 'body and soul' are so familiar
that it seems almost childish to ask how man
came at first to speak of body and soul. But what
did he mean by soul? What do we ourselves mean
by soul? Think of the many meanings contained in
our word soul. Our soul may mean the living soul;
it may mean the sentient soul; it may mean the seat
of the passions, whether good or bad; it may mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
the organ of thought; and lastly, the immortal
element in man. The question we have to ask is
not how man arrived at a name for soul, but how
he came for the first time to speak of something
different from the body.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, III.</em>
</p>


<p>The discovery of the soul, the first attempts at
naming the soul, started everywhere from the
simplest observations of material facts. The lesson
cannot be inculcated too often that the whole wealth
of our most abstract and spiritual words comes from a
small number of material or concrete terms.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, III.</em>
</p>


<p>We see that the way which led to the discovery
of a soul was pointed out to man as clearly
as was the way which led him to the discovery of the
gods. It was chiefly the breath, which almost visibly
left the body at the time of death, that suggested the
name of breath, and afterwards the thought of something
breathing, living, perceiving, willing, remembering,
and thinking within us. The name came first,
the name of the material breath. By dropping what
seemed material even in this airy breath, there remained
the first vague and airy concept of what we
call soul.</p>

<p>The worship of the spirits of the departed which,
under various forms, was so widely spread over
the ancient world, could not but accustom the human
mind to the idea that there was something in man
which deserved such worship. The souls of the
departed were lifted higher and higher, till at last
they reached the highest stage which existed in the
human mind, namely, that of divine beings, in the
ancient sense of that word.</p>

<p>The problem of uniting the invisible and visible
worlds presented itself under three principal
aspects. The first was the problem of creation, or
how the invisible Primal Cause could ever come in
contact with visible matter and impart to it form and
meaning. The second problem was the relation
between God and the individual soul. The third
problem was the return of the soul from the visible to
the invisible world, from the prison of its mortal body
to the freedom of a heavenly paradise. The individual
soul as dwelling in a material body forms
part of the created world, and the question of the
return of the soul to God is therefore closely connected
with that of its creation by, or its emanation
from, God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>


<p>When the original oneness of earth and heaven,
of the human and the divine natures, has
once been discovered, the question of the return of
the soul to God assumes a new character. It is no
longer a question of an ascension to heaven, an
approach to the throne of God, an ecstatic vision of
God, and a life in a heavenly Paradise. The vision
of God is rather the knowledge of the divine element
in the soul, and of the consubstantiality of the divine
and human natures. Immortality has no longer to be
asserted, because there can be no death for what is
divine, and therefore immortal, in man. There is life
eternal and peace eternal for all who feel the divine
Spirit as dwelling within them, and have thus become
the children of God.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Gifford Lectures, IV.</em>
</p>


<p>No doubt the soul must find it difficult in childhood
to accustom itself to the human body,
and it takes many years before it is quite at home.
Then for a time all goes well, and the soul hardly
knows it is hidden in a strange garment till the body
begins to be weakly, and can no longer do all the
soul wishes, and presses it everywhere, so that the
soul appears to lose all outward freedom and movement.
Then one can well understand that we long to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
be gone, and death is a true deliverance. God always
knows best when the right time comes.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Life.</em>
</p>


<p>Let us remember that we do not know what the
soul was before this life&mdash;nay, even what it
was during the first years of our childhood. Yet we
believe on very fair evidence that what we call our
soul existed from the moment of our birth. What
ground have we, then, to doubt that it was even
before that moment? To ascribe to the soul a beginning
on our birthday would be the same as to claim
for it an end on the day of our death, for whatever
has a beginning has an end. If then, in the absence
of any other means of knowledge, we may take refuge
in analogy, might we not say that it will be with the
soul hereafter as it has been here, and that the soul
after its earthly setting will rise again, much as it
rose here? This is not a syllogism, it is analogy, and
in a cosmos like ours analogy has a right to claim
some weight, in the absence of any proof to the
contrary.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Last Essays.</em>
</p>


<p>There is a question which has probably been
asked by every human heart&mdash;Granting that
the soul cannot, without self-contradiction, be mortal,
will that soul be itself, know itself, and will it know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
others whom it has known before? For the next life,
it is said, would not be worth living if the soul did
not recollect itself, recognise not only itself, but those
whom it has known and loved on earth. Here
analogy alone can supply some kind of answer: 'It
will be hereafter as it has been' is not, in the absence
of any evidence to the contrary, an argument that can
be treated with contempt. Our soul here may be said
to have risen without any recollection of itself and of
the circumstances of its former existence. But it has
within it the consciousness of its eternity, and the conception
of a beginning is as impossible for it as that
of an end, and if souls were to meet again hereafter
as they met in this life, as they loved in this life,
without knowing that they had met and loved before,
would the next life be so very different from what this
life has been here on earth&mdash;would it be so utterly
intolerable and really not worth living?</p>

<p>When the soul has once reached that union with
God, nay, when it lives in the constant
presence of God, evil becomes almost impossible.
We know that most of the evil deeds to which
human nature is prone are possible in the dark only.
Before the eyes of another human being, more particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
of a beloved being, they become at once
impossible. How much more in the real presence of
a real and really beloved God, as felt by the true
mystic, not merely as a phrase, but as a fact? As
long as there is no veil between him and God, evil
thoughts, evil words, and evil deeds are simply impossible
to one who feels the actual presence of God.
Nor is he troubled any longer by questions, such as
how the world was created, how evil came into the
world. He is satisfied with the Divine Love that
embraces his soul; he has all that he can desire, his
whole life is hid through Christ in God, death is
swallowed up in victory, the mortal has become
immortal, neither death nor life, nor things present,
nor things to come, is able to separate his soul from
the love of God.</p>

<h2>THEOSOPHY</h2>


<p>This venerable name (Theosophy), so well known
among early Christian thinkers, as expressing
the highest conception of God within the reach of the
human mind, has of late been so greatly misappropriated
that it is high time to restore it to its proper
function. It should be known once for all that one
may call oneself a theosophist without ... believing
in any occult sciences and black art.</p>

<p>There is nothing esoteric in Buddhism. Buddhism
is the very opposite of esoteric&mdash;it is a religion
for the people at large, for the poor, the suffering, the
ill-treated. Buddha protests against the very idea of
keeping anything secret. There was much more of
that esoteric teaching in Brâhmanism. There was the
system of caste, which deprived the Sûdras, at least,
of many religious privileges. But I do say that even
in Brâhmanism there is <em>no such thing as an esoteric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
interpretation of the Sâstras.</em> The Sâstras have but
one meaning, and all who had been properly prepared
by education had access to them. There are some
artificial poems, which are so written as to admit of
two interpretations. They are very wonderful, but
they have nothing to do with philosophical doctrines.
Again, there are erotic poems in Sanscrit which are
explained as celebrating the love and union between
the soul and God. But all this is perfectly well
known, there is no mystery in it.</p>

<h2>TRUTH</h2>


<p>What is wanted is the power of sifting evidence,
and a simple love of truth. Whatever value

<p>True reverence does not consist in declaring a
subject, because it is dear to us, to be unfit for
free, and honest inquiry; far from it! True reverence
is shown in treating every subject, however

without fear and without favour; with tenderness
and love, by all means, but, before all, with unflinching
and uncompromising loyalty to truth.</p>

<p>Do we lose anything if we find that what we hold

belief in God by the unanimous testimony of mankind.
They made the greatest efforts to prove that
there was no race so degraded and barbarous as to be
without a belief in something divine. Some modern
theologians seem to grudge to all religions but their
own the credit of having a pure and true, nay any
concept of God at all, quite forgetful of the fact
that a truth does not cease to be a truth because it
is accepted universally. I know no heresy more
dangerous to true religion than this denial that a
true concept of God is within the reach of every
human being, is, in fact, the common inheritance of
mankind, however fearfully it may have been misused
and profaned by Christian and un-Christian
nations.</p>

<p>If Comparative Theology has taught us anything,
it has taught us that there is a common fund of
truth in all religions, derived from a revelation that
was neither confined to one nation, nor miraculous in
the usual sense of that word, and that even minute
coincidences between the doctrines, nay, between the
external accessories of various religions, need not be
accounted for at once by disguised borrowings, but
can be explained by other and more natural causes.</p>

<p>It may be quite right to guard against dangers,
whether real or imaginary, so long as it is
possible. But when it is no longer possible, the
right thing is to face an enemy bravely. Very often
the enemy will turn out a friend in disguise. We
cannot be far wrong, if we are only quite honest,
but if we are once not quite honest over a few things,
we shall soon become dishonest over many things.
In teaching on religion, even on Natural religion, we
must look neither right nor left, but look all facts
straight in the face, to see whether they are facts or
not, and, if they are facts, to find out what they
mean.</p>

we know the shadow only, and not the light that

Why do people differ, considering
that they all begin with the same love of truth, and
are all influenced by the same environment? Well,
they often differ because one is ignorant of facts which
the other knows and has specially studied.... But
in most cases people differ because they use their
words loosely, and because they mix up different subjects
instead of treating them one by one.</p>

<h2>THE WILL OF GOD</h2>


<p>Through my whole life I have learnt this one
lesson, that nothing can happen to us, unless
it be the will of God. There can be no disappointment
in life, if we but learn to submit our will to the
will of God. Let us wait for a little while, and to those
whose eyes are turned to God and eternity the longest
life is but a little while,&mdash;let us wait then in faith,
hope, and charity: these three abide, but the greatest
of these is charity.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Life.</em>
</p>


<p>Whatever happens to us is always the best
for us, even if we do not at once understand
and perceive it.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>MS.</em>
</p>


<p>Surely everything is ordered, and ordered for our
true interests. It would be fearful to think that
anything, however small in appearance, could happen
to us without the will of God. If you admit the idea
of chance or unmeaning events anywhere, the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
organisation of our life in God is broken to pieces.
We are we don't know where, unless we rest in God
and give Him praise for all things. We must trust in
Him whether he sends us joy or sorrow. If he sends
us joy let us be careful. Happiness is often sent to
try us, and is by no means a proof of our having
deserved it. Nor is sorrow always a sign of God's
displeasure, but frequently, nay always, of His love
and compassion. We must each interpret our life as
best we can, but we must be sure that its deepest
purpose is to bring us back to God through Christ.
Death is a condition of our life on earth, it brings the
creature back to its Creator. The creature groans at
the sight of death, but God will not forsake us at the
last, He who has never forsaken us from the first
breath of our life on earth. If it is His will we may
live to serve Him here on earth for many happy years
to come. If He takes either of us away, His name
be praised. We live in the shadow of death, but
that shadow should not darken the brightness of our
life. It is the shadow of the hand of our God and
Father, and the earnest of a higher, brighter life hereafter.
Our Father in heaven loves us more than any
husband can love his wife, or any mother her child.
His hand can never hurt us, so let us hope and trust
always.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>Life.</em>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>


<p>Our lives are in the hands of a Father, who knows
what is best for all of us. Death is painful to
the creature, but in God there is no death, no dying;
dying belongs to life, and is only a passage to a more
perfect world into which we all go when God calls
us. When one's happiness is perfect, then the thought
of death often frightens one, but even that is conquered
by the feeling and the faith that all is best as it
is, and that God loves us more than even a father and
mother can love us. It is a beautiful world in which
we live, but it is only beautiful and only really our
home when we feel the nearness of God at each
moment and lean on Him and trust in His love....
When the hour of parting comes, we know that
love never dies, and that God who bound us closely
together in this life will bring us together where there
is no more parting.</p>

<p class="sig">
<em>MS.</em>
</p>


<p>Our meeting here on earth with those we loved
was not our doing. We did not select our
father and mother, and sisters and brothers. We did
not even explore the whole world to discover our
friends. They too were more or less given us, the
choice was given us, and the sphere of choice was
determined and limited. Hence we seem to have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
right to say that they were meant for us, and we for
them, and unless we believe in accident, who is there
by whose will alone they could have been meant for
us? Hence, if they were meant for us once by a
Divine, not by our own will, that will can never
change, and we have a right to hope and even to
believe that <em>what has been will be</em>, and that we shall
again meet and love those whom we met and loved
here. This is faith, and this is comfort, but it is
greater faith, and greater comfort still, if we close our
eyes in the firm conviction that whatever will be, will
be best for us.</p>

<h2>WONDER</h2>


<p>There are few sensations more pleasant than that
of wondering. We have all experienced it in
childhood, in youth, in manhood, and we may hope
that even in our old age this affection of the mind
will not entirely pass away. If we analyse this feeling
of wonder carefully, we shall find that it consists of
two elements. What we mean by wondering is not
only that we are startled or stunned&mdash;that I should
call the merely passive element of wonder. When
we say 'I wonder' we confess that we are taken
aback, but there is a secret satisfaction mixed up
with our feeling of surprise, a kind of hope, nay,
almost of certainty, that sooner or later the wonder
will cease, that our senses or our mind will recover,
will grapple with these novel expressions or experiences,
grasp them, it may be, know them, and finally
triumph over them. In fact we wonder at the riddles
of nature, whether animate or inanimate, with a firm
conviction that there is a solution to them all, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
though we ourselves may not be able to find it.
Wonder, no doubt, arises from ignorance, but from a
peculiar kind of ignorance, from what might be called
a fertile ignorance; an ignorance which, if we look
back at the history of most of our sciences, will be
found to have been the mother of all human knowledge.</p>

<h2>WORDS</h2>


<p>What people call 'mere words' are in truth the
monuments of the fiercest intellectual battles;
triumphant arches of the grandest victories won by
the intellect of man. When man had formed names
for body and soul, for father and mother, and not till
then, did the first art of human history begin. Not
till there were names for right and wrong, for God
and man, could there be anything worthy of the name
of human society. Every new word was a discovery,
and these early discoveries, if but properly understood,
are more important to us than the greatest conquests
of the kings of Egypt and Babylon. Not one of
our greatest explorers has unearthed more splendid
palaces, than the etymologist. Every word is the
palace of a human thought, and in scientific etymology
we possess the charm with which to call these ancient
thoughts back to life.</p>

<p>Cannot a concept exist without a word? Certainly
not, though in order to meet every
possible objection we may say that no concept can
exist without a sign, whether it be a word or anything
else. And if it is asked whether the concept
exists first, and the sign comes afterwards, I should
say no: the two are simultaneous, but in strict logic,
the sign, being the condition of a concept, may really
be said to come first. After a time, words may be
dropt, and it is then, when we try to remember the
old word that gave birth to our concept, that we are
led to imagine that concepts came first, and words
afterwards. I know how difficult it is to see this
clearly. We are so accustomed to think without
words, that we can hardly realise the fact that
originally no conceptual thought was possible without
these or other signs.</p>

<h2>WORK</h2>


<p>If you have found a work to which you are ready
to sacrifice the whole of your life, and if you
have faith in yourselves, others will have faith in you,
and, sooner or later, a work that must be done will
be done.</p>

<p>What flimsy things the so-called pleasures of
life are&mdash;how little in them that lasts. To
delight in doing one's work is life&mdash;that is what helps
us on, though the road is sometimes very stiff and
tiring&mdash;uphill rather it would seem than downhill, and
yet downhill it is.</p>

<p>A distaste for work is only another name for a
distaste for duty, a disregard for those commandments
which hold society together, a disregard
of the commandments of God. No doubt there is that
reward in work that after a time it ceases to be distasteful,
and like many a bitter medicine becomes liked, but
that reward is vouchsafed to honest work only.</p>

<p>No sensible man ought to care about posthumous
praise, or posthumous blame. Enough for the
day is the evil thereof. Our contemporaries are our
right judges, our peers have to give their votes in the
great academies and learned societies, and if they on
the whole are not dissatisfied with the little we have
done, often under far greater difficulties than the
world was aware of, why should we care for the
distant future?</p>

<p>Much of the best work in the world is done by
those whose names remain unknown, who
work because life's greatest bliss is work, and who
require no reward beyond the consciousness that they
have enlarged the knowledge of mankind and contributed
their share to the final triumph of honesty
and truth.</p>

<p>True immortality (of fame) is the immortality of
the work done by man, which nothing can
make undone, which lives, works on, grows on for
ever. It is good to <em>ourselves</em> to remember and honour
the names of our ancestors and benefactors, but to
them, depend upon it, the highest reward was not the
hope of fame, but their faith in themselves, their faith
in their work, their faith that nothing really good can
ever perish, and that Right and Reason must in the
end prevail.</p>

<h2>THE WORLD</h2>


<p>There is no other Christian explanation of the
world than that God thought and uttered it,
and that man follows in life and thought the thoughts
of God. We must not forget that all our knowledge
and hold of the world are again nothing but thoughts,
which we transform under the law of causality into
objective realities. It was this unswerving dependence
on God in thought and life that made Jesus what He
was, and what we should be if we only tried, viz.
children of God.</p>

<p>Think only what it was to believe in an order
of the world, though it be no more at first
than a belief that the sun will never overstep his
bounds. It was all the difference between a chaos
and a cosmos, between the blind play of chance
and an intelligible and therefore an intelligent
providence. How many souls, even now when
everything else has failed them, when they have
parted with the most cherished convictions of their
childhood, when their faith in man has been poisoned,
and when the apparent triumph of all that is selfish,
ignoble, and hideous has made them throw up the
cause of truth, of righteousness, and innocence as
no longer worth fighting for, at least in this world;
how many, I say, have found their last peace and
comfort in the contemplation of the order of the
world, whether manifested in the unvarying movement
of the stars, or revealed in the unvarying
number of the petals and stamens and pistils of the
smallest forget-me-not. How many have felt that
to belong to this cosmos, to this beautiful order of
nature, is something at least to rest on, something
to trust, something to believe, when everything else
has failed. To us, this perception of law and order
in the world may seem very little, but to the ancient
dwellers on earth, who had little else to support them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
it was everything because, if once perceived, if once
understood, it could never be taken from them.</p>

<p>We must learn to see a meaning in everything.
No doubt we cannot always see cause and
effect, and it is well we cannot. It is quite true
that we do not always get our deserts. And yet
we must believe that we do&mdash;only if we knew it,
the whole fabric of the world would be destroyed,
there would be neither virtue nor vice in the whole
world, nothing but calculation. We should avoid
the rails laid down by the world because we should
know that the engine would be sure to come and
mangle us. In this way the world holds together,
and it could not in any other way.</p>

<p>There is to me a beauty and mystery and sanctity
about flowers, and when I see them come and
go, no one knows whence and whither, I ask what
more miracles do we want,&mdash;what better, more
beautiful, more orderly world could we wish to
belong to than that by which we are surrounded
and supported on all sides? Where is there a flaw
or a fault? Then why should we fear unless the
flaws are within us, and we will not see the blessing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
and the rest which we might enjoy if we only trusted
to the Author of all that beauty, order, and wisdom
about us. It is a perfect sin not to be happy in this
world, and how much of the misery which there is,
is the work of men, or could be removed by men, if
they would but work together for each others' good.</p>
